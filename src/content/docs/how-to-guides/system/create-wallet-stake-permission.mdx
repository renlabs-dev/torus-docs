In this guide, we'll walk through how to create wallet permissions in the Torus Portal.
Wallet permissions enable cold-hot wallet behavior, allowing you to delegate staking operations
to more accessible accounts while keeping your primary keys securely stored offline.

## Why Create Wallet Permission?

You want to maintain high security for your primary wallet while still being able to manage staking operations efficiently.
Wallet permissions let you delegate staking management to hot wallets without exposing your principal funds to transfer risks.

## Create Wallet Permission


<Steps>

1. **Visit the [Wallet Permissions Tab in the Torus Portal](https://portal.torus.network/permissions/create-permission/wallet)**  
   Click the <RedText variant="light">**Wallet Permission**</RedText> tab under Permissions in the Torus Portal.

2. **Connect your Cold Wallet**  
   Ensure you're <RedText variant="light">connected with the wallet account</RedText> that holds the stakes you want to delegate management for.

3. **Fill the form**  
   ```md
   # Recipient Address  
   Search agents by name or address that will receive the staking permission.
   If your target is not an agent, you can enter the wallet address directly.

   # Stake Permissions  
   - **Exclusive Delegation**: Grant exclusive access to stake operations 
   (prevents delegator from using stake directly)
   - **Allow Stake Movement**: Delegate permission to unstake, 
   exclusively granting it to the recipient

   # Duration  
   - **Indefinite**: Permission remains valid indefinitely
   - **Until Block**: Permission expires at a specific block

   # Revocation Terms  
   - **Irrevocable**: Cannot be revoked
   - **Revocable by Delegator**: Only you can revoke this permission
   - **Revocable After**: Can be revoked after a specific condition is met
   ```
   
   <Aside type="note">
   **Operation Constraints**   
   All delegated operations are limited to existing stakes only. The recipient cannot:
   - Create new stakes from your available balance
   - Transfer your principal funds
   - Access non-staking wallet operations
   </Aside>

4. **Submit and Sign Transaction**  

   Click <RedText variant="light">**Create Wallet Permission**</RedText>.  
   Open SubWallet and <RedText variant="light">sign the transaction</RedText>.

5. **All Done**  
   You've successfully created the wallet permission.  

   The receiving account can now manage your staking operations within the limits you've set.
