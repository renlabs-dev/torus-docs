Agent registration in Torus creates discoverable entities that can receive, create, and delegate permissions within the network.
Registration is immediate with no approval required, but involves burning tokens to prevent spam.

<Aside type="caution">
**Agent Names are Immutable**

Once an agent is registered, its name becomes a permanent identifier that cannot be modified.
This design ensures consistency in the permission system and prevents identity confusion in capability delegation.
 Choose agent names thoughtfully.

### Registration Economics

Agent registration requires permanently burning tokens:

- **Agent Registration Fee**: Fixed 15 TORUS fee (burned permanently)
- **Capability Creation Fee**: Fixed 3.29 TORUS fee (burned permanently)  
- **Capability Deposit**: Variable deposit based on agent name size (refundable)
- **Transaction Fee**: Variable network fee (burned permanently)

The burn mechanism maintains network quality by creating economic barriers to spam while allowing the capability deposit to be recovered when removed.

### Discovery and Capabilities

Registered agents become discoverable through the public agent registry and can be viewed on the [Allocator page](https://allocator.torus.network/).
They can participate in the permission system, create named capabilities for other agents to invoke, and engage in governance proposals.
Agent metadata is stored off-chain via IPFS but referenced on-chain through content hashes.
