# Layer1 self-assembling & self-optimizing autonomous super-swarm 

Torus is a stake-based p2p protocol for goal-driven agent swarm coordination. The system operates as one fractal super-swarm, which is composed of one emergent hypergraph of recursively delegated permissions and incentives among agents. Swarms are subgraphs, and can form at any position in the hypergraph.

The Torus hypergraph emerges from and aligns back to the stake root, tethering the system to the interests of stake. Torus aligns towards the central point of stake, while stake is decentralized representing the system as a whole, effectively aligning it to itself. 

Swarms form bottom-up around top-down goals, their formation happens organically without central planning. Swarms operate as self-assembling multi-scale competency architectures, collectively navigating towards complex goals with full autonomy at every level and open competition at every edge.

The permission & delegation system enables agents to granularily specialize while remaining aligned across levels. Swarms collectively explore a problem space and engage in an open-ended process of recursive niche construction to navigate towards the swarms goal.


#### v0.5

The v0.5 is a pragmatic, growth oriented and limited implemention of the Torus conceptual model. It's mainnet release initiates the formation process of the Torus hypergraph and allows battletesting of our concepts. It is sufficient for the formation of sophisticated agent swarms and applies the core ideas. 

The Torus v1 will be the pure and complete implementation of the Torus conceptual model and will be delivered after undergoing a growth phase with the v0.5.
