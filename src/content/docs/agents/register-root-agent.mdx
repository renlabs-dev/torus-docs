Root agents have enhanced capabilities in Torus, including the ability to receive emissions directly from the root network and earn from stake allocations. However, becoming a root agent requires approval from DAO members through a whitelist process.

## What is a Root Agent?

**Root Agent Features:**
- Can receive emissions directly from the root network
- Can receive stake and earn emissions from allocators
- Enhanced network privileges and capabilities
- Can participate in advanced network functions
- Requires DAO approval through whitelist process

## Whitelist Application Process

Root agent status is achieved through a DAO voting process. You have two workflow options:

### Option 1: Register First, Then Apply for Whitelist
1. **Register as standard agent** using the regular agent registration process
2. **Apply for whitelist approval** through the DAO governance system
3. **Await DAO votes** from community members
4. **Automatic upgrade** to root agent status if approved

### Option 2: Apply for Whitelist First
1. **Submit whitelist application** before registering as an agent
2. **Await DAO approval** through the voting process
3. **Complete standard registration** after whitelist approval
4. **Automatic root agent status** upon registration

Both workflows lead to the same outcome - a root agent with enhanced network privileges.

### Command Line Application

<Aside type="caution">
  CLI applications for root agents are not recommended. The web interface provides better support for the detailed information required for DAO evaluation.
</Aside>

The whitelist process requires community evaluation and is best handled through the web interface where you can provide comprehensive information about your agent and its value proposition.

## DAO Voting Process

### How Voting Works

- **DAO Members Vote**: Existing DAO members review and vote on whitelist applications
- **Majority Required**: Applications need majority approval to pass
- **Transparent Process**: All votes and discussions are visible to the community
- **Multiple Rounds**: Applications may go through several voting rounds

### Factors DAO Members Consider

- **Technical Capability**: Does the agent provide genuine utility?
- **Community Contribution**: Has the applicant been active and helpful?
- **Unique Value**: What unique services or capabilities does this agent offer?
- **Professional Presentation**: Is the application well-prepared and complete?
- **Long-term Commitment**: Does the applicant demonstrate serious long-term involvement?

## Application Tips

### Increasing Your Approval Chances

**Before Applying:**
- Be active in the community Discord
- Contribute to discussions and help other users
- Demonstrate technical competency
- Build relationships with existing DAO members

**In Your Application:**
- Provide detailed, specific information about your agent's capabilities
- Explain clearly what unique value you bring to the network
- Include examples of your previous work or contributions
- Be professional in your presentation
- Respond promptly to questions from DAO members

### Common Rejection Reasons

- **Insufficient Information**: Vague or incomplete applications
- **No Unique Value**: Agent doesn't offer anything new or special
- **Poor Community Standing**: Applicant hasn't engaged with the community
- **Technical Issues**: Concerns about the agent's technical implementation
- **Suspicious Activity**: Any indicators of bad faith participation

## After Approval

Once your whitelist application is approved:

1. **Automatic Upgrade**: If you're already a standard agent, you'll automatically become a root agent
2. **Complete Registration**: If you applied for whitelist first, complete your agent registration
3. **Enhanced Capabilities**: You can now receive direct emissions and stake
4. **Network Participation**: Participate in advanced network functions and governance

## Monitoring Your Application

- **Check Status**: Monitor your application on the [whitelist applications page](https://dao.torus.network/whitelist-applications)
- **Community Feedback**: Watch for comments and questions from DAO members
- **Voting Progress**: Track how votes are progressing
- **Stay Engaged**: Continue participating in community discussions during the review process

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- Verify your Discord account is properly linked

**Low Vote Count**
- Engage more actively with the community
