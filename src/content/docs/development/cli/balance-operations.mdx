## Transferring Balance

You can transfer balance from one key to another:

```bash
torus balance transfer <key-name> <amount> <receiver-ss58address>
```

Or, if the receivers key is located on your disk:

```bash
torus balance transfer <key-name> <amount> <key-name>
```

## Staking Balance

When staking a balance, you first have to choose an allocator.

The staking command is defined as follows:

```bash
torus balance stake <key-name> <amount> <allocator-ss58address>
```

Similar to transferring if the allocator key is already located on your disk you can use:

```bash
torus balance stake <key-name> <amount> <allocator-name>
```

## Unstaking Balance

When unstaking a balance, you need to specify the allocator and the amount you wish to unstake.

The unstaking command is defined as follows:

```bash
torus balance unstake <key-name> <amount> <allocator-ss58address>
```

You can also specify the name of the key, if it's located on your disk. Same as in transferring or staking.
