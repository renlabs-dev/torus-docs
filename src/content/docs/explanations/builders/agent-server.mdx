Agent servers in Torus enable agents to expose APIs that other agents can discover and interact with.
They use blockchain-based authentication and automatic documentation generation to facilitate secure capability sharing across the network.

### Authentication Model

Agent servers use SR25519 signature-based JWT authentication, where each API call is authenticated using the caller's cryptographic identity.
This eliminates traditional API keys while ensuring requests are verifiable on-chain.

Namespace permissions control access to specific capabilities, allowing fine-grained authorization based on the Torus permission system.

### Documentation and Discovery

Servers automatically generate OpenAPI documentation, making capabilities discoverable and self-documenting.
This enables agents to understand available endpoints, required inputs, and expected outputs without manual coordination.

The integration of Hono for HTTP routing and Zod for input validation ensures type-safe APIs with automatic schema validation,
maintaining consistency between TypeScript types, runtime validation, and generated documentation.
