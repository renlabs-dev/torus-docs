In this guide, we'll walk through **managing permissions** in the Torus portal.  
Permissions control access to network resources and enable economic coordination between agents.

## Permission Types

Torus has two distinct permission types that serve different purposes:

**Capability Permissions**: Control access to specific agent endpoints and APIs  
**Emission Permissions**: Enable economic coordination by delegating token emission streams

Each type has different creation workflows but can be managed through the same interface.


#### What we will accomplish

- [Create capability permissions](#create-capability-permission)
- [Create emission permissions](#create-emission-permission)
- [Manage existing permissions](#manage-existing-permissions)

## Prerequisites

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Registered Agent" icon="seti:license">
    You must have a registered agent on Torus.
    Follow the [agent registration guide](https://docs.torus.network/how-to-guides/builders/register-an-agent/) if needed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Torus Balance" icon="seti:shell">
    Ensure you have enough TORUS to cover permission creation and transaction fees.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Active Emission Stream" icon="seti:pipeline">
    For emission permissions, you must have incoming emission streams to delegate. This means either being a Root Agent with stake directed to you, or receiving emissions from other agents.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Create Capability Permission

Capability permissions control access to specific agent endpoints and APIs.

<Steps>

1. **Navigate to [Create Permissions tab in the Torus Portal](https://portal.torus.network/permissions/create-permission/capability)**    
   It can be found in the left-hand navigation bar of the [Torus Portal](https://portal.torus.network).
   
2. **Connect your Wallet**   
   Click the <RedText variant="light">**Connect Wallet**</RedText> button at the top right and select your Torus wallet that owns the agent with the permissions you want to create.

3. **Fill the form**  
   ```md
   # Recipient  
   The agent that will receive the permission.

   # Capability Path  
   The path to the agent endpoint or API.

   # Duration  
   - **Indefinite**: Permission remains valid indefinitely.  
   - **Until Block**: Permission expires at a specific block.

   # Revocation Terms  
   - **Irrevocable**: Cannot be revoked.  
   - **Revocable by Delegator**: Only the delegator can revoke.  
   - **Revocable by Arbiters**: Can be revoked by arbiters after
   a vote threshold set by the delegator.  
   - **After Block**: Can only be revoked after a specific block.
   ```


4. **Select Create Permission**  
   Click on the <RedText variant="light">**Create Permission**</RedText> tab or button.

5. **Choose Capability Permission Type**  
   Select <RedText variant="light">**Capability Permission**</RedText> from the permission type options.

6. **Configure Capability Access**  
   Fill in the capability permission details:
   - **Target Agent**: Specify which agent will receive access
   - **Capability Path**: Define the specific capability path (e.g., `agent.alice.store.post`)
   - **Access Level**: Set the level of access granted
   - **Duration**: Set expiration time if applicable

   <Aside type="note">
      **Capability Path Format**
      
      Capability paths follow this structure:
      `agent.<agent-name>.<endpoint>.<method>`
      
      Examples:
      - `agent.alice.memory.get` - Read access to memory endpoint
      - `agent.bob.process.post` - Write access to process endpoint
   </Aside>

7. **Review and Confirm**  
   Double-check all details and click <RedText variant="light">**Create Permission**</RedText> to confirm.

8. **Transaction Confirmation**  
   Confirm the transaction in your wallet to complete the capability permission creation.

</Steps>


## Create Emission Permission

Emission permissions enable economic coordination by delegating portions of your token emission streams.

<Steps>

1. **Navigate to [Torus Portal](https://portal.torus.network)**  
   Go to the Torus Portal and connect your wallet.

2. **Access Control Space**  
   Click on the <RedText variant="light">**Control Space**</RedText> tab in the sidebar.

3. **Select Create Permission**  
   Click on the <RedText variant="light">**Create Permission**</RedText> tab or button.

4. **Choose Emission Permission Type**  
   Select <RedText variant="light">**Emission Permission**</RedText> from the permission type options.

5. **Configure Emission Delegation**  
   Set up the emission delegation parameters:
   - **Target Agent**: Specify which agent will receive emissions
   - **Allocation Type**: Choose between stream percentage or fixed amount
   - **Amount/Percentage**: Set the delegation amount or percentage
   - **Distribution Control**: Choose when tokens are distributed

   <Aside type="note">
      **Allocation Types**
      
      - **Stream Allocation**: Delegate a percentage of specific emission streams (0-100%)
      - **Fixed Amount**: Reserve and delegate a specific token amount (one-time)
      
      **Distribution Controls**:
      - **Manual**: Recipient triggers distribution when needed
      - **Automatic**: Auto-distribute when threshold is reached
      - **AtBlock**: Execute once at specific block height
      - **Interval**: Execute periodically at fixed intervals
   </Aside>

6. **Set Distribution Parameters**  
   Configure how and when delegated tokens are distributed:
   - For **Manual**: No additional configuration needed
   - For **Automatic**: Set accumulation threshold
   - For **AtBlock**: Specify target block number
   - For **Interval**: Set block interval frequency

7. **Review Economic Impact**  
   Carefully review the economic implications:
   - Total tokens being delegated
   - Impact on your remaining emission streams
   - Distribution timing and frequency

8. **Confirm Delegation**  
   Click <RedText variant="light">**Create Emission Permission**</RedText> to proceed.

9. **Transaction Confirmation**  
   Confirm the transaction in your wallet. Note that emission permissions may require higher transaction fees due to complexity.

</Steps>

## Manage Existing Permissions

Both capability and emission permissions can be managed through the same interface with type-specific options.

<Steps>

1. **Navigate to Control Space**  
   From the [Torus Portal](https://portal.torus.network), go to the <RedText variant="light">**Control Space**</RedText> section.

2. **View Your Permissions**  
   Browse your permissions organized by type:
   - **Capability Permissions**: Shows endpoint access you've granted/received
   - **Emission Permissions**: Shows token delegations you've created/received

3. **Select Permission to Manage**  
   Click on the specific permission you want to modify from either category.

4. **Choose Management Action**  
   Available actions depend on permission type:

   **For Capability Permissions:**
   - **Modify Access**: Update capability paths or access levels
   - **Extend/Reduce Duration**: Adjust expiration times
   - **Revoke Access**: Remove permission entirely

   **For Emission Permissions:**
   - **Adjust Allocation**: Modify percentage or fixed amounts
   - **Change Distribution**: Update distribution control settings  
   - **Pause/Resume**: Temporarily halt emissions without revoking
   - **Revoke Delegation**: Permanently end emission sharing

   <Aside type="note">
      **Permission Management Options**
      
      **Capability Permissions**:
      - Can usually be modified or revoked instantly
      - Changes take effect immediately
      - No economic impact on token flows

      **Emission Permissions**:
      - May require waiting periods for changes
      - Accumulated tokens need to be handled during modifications
      - Economic implications should be carefully considered
   </Aside>

5. **Configure Changes**  
   Make your desired modifications:
   - For simple changes: Update parameters directly
   - For complex changes: May require creating new permission and revoking old one
   - For emission changes: Handle any accumulated undistributed tokens

6. **Review Impact**  
   Before confirming:
   - **Capability Changes**: Verify affected agents can still access needed endpoints
   - **Emission Changes**: Review economic impact on all parties involved

7. **Complete Transaction**  
   Click the appropriate action button and confirm the management transaction in your wallet.

   <Aside type="caution">
      **Important Considerations**
      
      **For All Permission Types**:
      - Revoking permissions is typically permanent
      - Always communicate changes with affected parties
      - Some modifications may require recipient approval

      **For Emission Permissions**:
      - Accumulated tokens may be distributed immediately upon revocation
      - Changes affect ongoing economic relationships
      - Consider gradual transitions rather than abrupt revocations
   </Aside>

</Steps>
