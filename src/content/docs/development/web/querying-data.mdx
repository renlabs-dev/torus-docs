Our API allows you to retrieve information about the stake allocation between keys and agents.
You can query this data by making a GET request to: `https://allocator.torus.network/api/allocated-weight`.

## API Response Format

The API response has the following structure:

```json
{
    "<allocatingKey>": {
        "<agentKey>": <stake>
    }
} // allocatingKey and agentKey are both SS58Address strings.

```

## Filtering Options

    You can filter the API response based on specific allocating keys or agents using query parameters.

    - Filter by Allocating Key

        To filter the response for a specific allocating key, append the userKey query parameter to the API endpoint:

        ```allocator.torus.network/api/allocated-weight?userKey=<SS58Address>```
    - Filter by Agent Key

        To filter the response for specific agents, append the agentKey query parameter to the API endpoint:

        ```allocator.torus.network/api/allocated-weight?agentKey=<SS58Address>```


    <Aside type="note">
        Replace `<SS58Address>` with the desired allocating key address.
