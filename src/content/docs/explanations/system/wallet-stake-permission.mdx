The Wallet Permission Scope will enable granular delegation of all wallet operations through the Torus Permission System. Currently, only Stake operations are implemented as low-hanging fruit for wallet security improvements. 

The Wallet Stake Permission enables cold-hot wallet behavior, where high-value secured keys can delegate stake operations to less secure keys utilized only for active protocol participation. 

This feature also enables to create a highly secure offline cold-key that never interacts with any webapp and delegate Stake Permission as exclusive (delegator loses permission) & irrevocable to the new key. If your main key gets compromised the tokens cannot be unstaked and hence not transferred. However, an attacker could attempt to immediately transfer as soon as you choose to unstake. But as long as staked, tokens are untouchable.

It's not a perfect security feature and as standard practice it will eventually be replaced by Transfer Permissions, but it is a meaningful improvement and we recommend high-value keys to apply it.

### Core Functions of Stake Permission
* **Exclusive Delegation** The delegator key loses the wallet permission.
* **Improved Key Security:** Enables cold-hotkey behavior.
