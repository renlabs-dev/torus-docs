<Steps>

1. **Visit the [DAO Proposals Tab](https://dao.torus.network/proposals)**  
   Navigate to the proposals page where you can view all active, approved, and rejected proposals.

2. **Connect your Wallet**
   <RedText variant="light">Ensure you're connected with your TORUS wallet</RedText> that contains the tokens you want to use for voting.

3. **Click on Any Open Proposal**  
   <RedText variant="light">Click on any active proposal</RedText> you want to view to access the voting interface and settings.
   
   <ClickableImage src={clickOnOpenProposal} alt="Click on an open proposal" />

4. **Click on "Vote Power Settings"**  
   Look for the <RedText variant="light">**"Vote Power Settings"**</RedText> button located below the voting options. This allows you to toggle between delegating your voting power and becoming a power user.

5. **Check Your Current Voting Status**  
   When you click on the vote power settings button, you'll see your current status:
   
   - **Delegating your voting power (Default)**: <RedText variant="light">Validators handle voting on your behalf</RedText>
   - **Power user**: <RedText variant="light">You have direct control over your votes</RedText>

6. **Toggle Your Voting Status**  
   You can switch between voting modes anytime:
   
   - Click <RedText variant="light">**"Delegate Voting Power"**</RedText> to return control to validators
   - Click <RedText variant="light">**"Become a power user"**</RedText> to gain direct voting control
   
   <ClickableImage src={changeVoteStatus} alt="Change vote status" />

7. **Sign the Transaction**    
   Open your subwallet extension and <RedText variant="light">sign the transaction</RedText> to confirm the change.

8. **All Done**  
   Your voting power status has been successfully updated. You can now proceed to vote (if power user) or let validators vote on your behalf (if delegated).
