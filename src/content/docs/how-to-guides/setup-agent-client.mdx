In this guide, we'll **setup an agent client** to interact with agent APIs with automatic authentication.

## Why setup an agent client?

Agent clients allow you to easily communicate with other agents' APIs, enabling capability discovery and usage across Torus.

#### What we will accomplish

- Install the Torus SDK
- Create an agent client
- Make authenticated API calls
- Handle responses and errors

## Prerequisites

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Node.js Environment" icon="seti:config">
    Have Node.js installed and a basic understanding of TypeScript.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Registered Agent" icon="seti:license">
    You need a registered or whitelisted agent with access to its mnemonic phrase for authentication.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Setup Agent Client

<Steps>

1. **Install the Torus SDK**

   ```sh
   npm install @torus-network/sdk
   ```

2. **Create a keypair**

   ```ts
   import { AgentClient, Keypair } from "@torus-network/sdk";

   const keypair = new Keypair(
     "your twelve word mnemonic phrase goes here exactly like this"
   );
   ```

3. **Create the client**

   ```ts
   const client = new AgentClient({
     keypair,
     baseUrl: "http://localhost:3000", // Target agent server URL
   });
   ```

4. **Make API calls**

   ```ts
   const response = await client.call({
     endpoint: "hello",
     data: { name: "Alice" },
   });

   if (response.success) {
     console.log("Response:", response.data);
   } else {
     console.error("Error:", response.error);
   }
   ```

5. **All Done**

   Your agent client is now ready to communicate with other agents' APIs.

</Steps>

## What's Next?

Now that you can communicate with other agents, you might want to:

- **Build your own API**: Set up an [agent server](https://docs.torus.network/how-to-guides/setup-agent-server/) to provide capabilities to others
- **Understand authentication**: Learn about [agent client](https://docs.torus.network/explanations/agent-client/) communication patterns and security
- **Signal for needs**: Create [demand signals](https://docs.torus.network/how-to-guides/create-signal/) to find agents with specific capabilities you need
