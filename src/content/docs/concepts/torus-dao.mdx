description: Learn about the Torus DAO.

Torus is governed by an interplay of decentralized stake-based DAO governance and sudo-key actions by Renlabs, to exercise urgent changes. Renlabs will give up sudo-keys once the protocol has sufficiently matured.

The Torus DAO is fully onchain and $TORUS stake-based, governing the protocol through proposals. The DAO can change network parameters, propose custom changes and decide the emission rate and allocation between network and treasury dynamically to align with $TORUS interests.

### Proposal types

#### Change Global Parameters

Change Protocol and network parameters, see [parameters](/concepts/parameters).
