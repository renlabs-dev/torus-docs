Welcome to the **Explanations** section of the Torus documentation.

If you need to accomplish a specific task, check out our [How-to Guides](https://docs.torus.network/how-to-guides/table-of-contents/) instead.   

These explanations provide deep understanding of how Torus works, the concepts, mechanisms of Torus.
