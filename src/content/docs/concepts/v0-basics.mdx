### Network

The network consists of a dynamic set of registered agents and modules competing to attract incentive from the allocator to earn TORUS. Incentives are weight-based, representing share in the continuous emission distribution.

### Agent

An agent is a key registered to the network with a offchain entity, autonomous or human, producing actions.

### Module (TODO FIX: REALLY MODULE ?????????????)

A module is a key registered to the network with a offchain system providing a function to individual agents or the Torus.

<Aside type="tip">
  `Agents` and `Modules` are the same primitive onchain, their difference lies
  offchain.
</Aside>

### Allocator

The allocator is a permissionless web platform maintained by _Renlabs_ allowing stakeholders to allocate incentive weights among agents. Users delegate $TORUS to the allocator key to set weights with their stake through the web platform and receive dividends.

### Curator

The curator is the regulator entity of the network, curating the agent & incentive landscape to enforce alignment with protocol interests. The curator has 2 primary permissions:

<Steps>

1. Approving agents to join the network, and removing them if they become misaligned (managing a whitelist)

2. Alacing a penalty factor on agents, that scales the incentives of the agent and the dividends of the user who set weight on the agent, to correct and penalize over-incentivization detectable by common sense

</Steps>

The curator decision-making system is offchain, able to take any form and adapt, like an agent, a DAO or a trusted community member.

Multiple specializing curators can be active in parallel, permissioned by the root curator. The root curator can be replaced by the Torus DAO anytime.

### Torus DAO

The Torus DAO is fully onchain and $TORUS stake-based, governing the protocol through proposals. The DAO can change network parameters and decide the emission rate and allocation between network and treasury dynamically to align with $TORUS interests.

### Torus treasury

The treasury is a DAO-owned key able to accumulate emissions and receive transfers. Treasury funds are managed via DAO proposals to fund ecosystem initiatives.

### Weights

Weights are a expressive format to granularly represent the relative value of agents & modules to network to distribute incentives. An agent with a weight of 0.01 means a 1% share in the total incentive being continuously distributed.
