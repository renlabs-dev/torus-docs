This guide explains how to set up and run a local Torus Substrate node, noting that its storage may differ slightly from the mainnet.

<Aside title="Must Have">

    - Git
    - Rust and Cargo (latest stable version)

## Building from source

### Dependencies

The recommended way to install dependencies is [using Nix](docs/nix.md).

If you don't want to use Nix, you should have the following dependencies:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [protoc](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf)

You can install Rust using [Rustup]:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Then install `protoc`:

```sh
# on Ubuntu
sudo apt install protobuf-compiler
```

{/*
# on Arch
sudo pacman -S protobuf
# on macOS
brew install protobuf
*/}

[Rustup]: https://rustup.rs/

## Building and running the node

```sh
cargo build -p torus-node --release
```

To run a node connected to the Torus testnet:

```sh
cargo run --bin torus-node --release -- --chain data/testnet/spec.json
```

## Docker

TODO

## Development

Check your code with:

```sh
cargo clippy
```

Run all tests with:

```sh
cargo test
```

Running a local dev node:

```sh
cargo xtask run local --alice
```

## Additional Information

- The `--alice` and `--bob` flags are used to run predefined validator nodes.
- You can customize your node's configuration by modifying the appropriate files in the project.
