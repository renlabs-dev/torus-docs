Stake is the organism's root container of authority and monetary energy, transmutable towards its emergent agency.
Forming a circular value flow between incentives and stake in their outcome. Stake is permissionless, while everything else is permissioned by stake.

Staking is the core mechanism through which TORUS holders secure the network, participate in governance,
and earn rewards while supporting the agents and initiatives they believe in.


### Core Mechanics

- When you stake, your TORUS are **locked** in the Root Allocator
- Tokens remain **owned by the staker** but cannot be used for transaction purposes
- It accounts for network consensus, such as, voting, allocating and commenting on proposals
- Staking rewards are generated from network emissions
