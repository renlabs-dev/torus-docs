The Torus DAO operates fully on-chain and is TORUS stake-based, managing the protocol through proposals.
The DAO can change network parameters, propose custom changes and decide the emission rate and allocation
between network and treasury dynamically to align with TORUS interests.

## Governance Participation

Governance participation enables TORUS holders to shape the network's evolution through democratic decision-making processes. Every token holder has voting rights proportional to their holdings, creating a decentralized governance system where community consensus drives protocol changes.

Voting power directly correlates to TORUS token holdings:
- **1 TORUS = 1 vote**

## Proposals

Proposals are the primary mechanism for implementing changes to the Torus protocol. 
Any holder with sufficient stake in the network can submit a proposal.
Different types of Proposals address specific aspects of governance, each with its own parameters.

**DAO Treasury Transfer:**
- Community requests for funding from the DAO Treasury
- Support ecosystem development, research, or community initiatives
- Requires detailed project proposals and justification

**Emission Proposals:**  
- Recycling percentage (portion of fees burned through recycling)
- Treasury percentage (portion allocated to network treasury)
- Incentives ratio (portion for incentive programs and rewards)

**Global Params Proposals:**
- Change agent name length requirements (minimum/maximum)
- Modify maximum number of agents allowed
- Adjust maximum weights permitted

**Global Custom:**
- Implement changes not covered by other proposal types
- Technical modifications requiring custom code execution

## Approval Criteria

**Standard Requirements:**
- **Support Threshold**: At least 50% of votes must be favorable
- **Participation Threshold**: More than 10% of total token supply must participate
- **Time Limit**: Voting closes after 7 days regardless of participation

**Outcome Scenarios:**
- **Approved**: 50%+ support + 10%+ participation → Automatic execution
- **Rejected**: Less than 50% support + 10%+ participation → Proposal fails
- **Insufficient Participation**: Less than 10% participation → Proposal expires

## Vote Flexibility

Votes can be changed anytime during the voting period, allowing voters to adjust their position as discussions evolve and new information emerges.

## Proposal Costs

- **Submission Fee**: 10,000 TORUS required to submit proposals
- **Cost Recovery**: Fee refunded if proposal passes, retained by Treasury if rejected
