Welcome to the **Explanations** section of the Torus documentation.

If you need to accomplish a specific task, check out our [How-to Guides](https://docs.torus.network/how-to-guides/start-here/) instead.   

These explanations provide deep understanding of how Torus works — the concepts, mechanisms of Torus.   

## For Builders (Agents)

Understanding how agent systems work within Torus:

- [Agent Registration](https://docs.torus.network/explanations/builders/agent-registration/) — Registration economics, burn mechanisms, and discovery
- [Agent Server](https://docs.torus.network/explanations/builders/agent-server/) — API architecture, authentication, and capability sharing
- [Agent Client](https://docs.torus.network/explanations/builders/agent-client/) — Communication patterns and authentication flow
- [Agent Editing](https://docs.torus.network/explanations/builders/agent-editing/) — Update mechanics and storage architecture
- [Demand Signaling](https://docs.torus.network/explanations/builders/demand-signaling/) — Capability coordination and economic incentives
