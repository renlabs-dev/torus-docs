Governance participation enables TORUS holders to shape the network's evolution through democratic decision-making processes.
Every token holder has voting rights proportional to their holdings,
creating a decentralized governance system where community consensus drives protocol changes.

Voting power directly correlates to TORUS token holdings:
- **1 TORUS = 1 vote**

Right now,

### Treasury Transfer Proposals:
Community requests for funding from the DAO Treasury to support ecosystem development, research, or community initiatives.

**Voting Considerations:**
- Project viability and team credibility
- Benefit to the Torus ecosystem
- Budget reasonableness and timeline
- Alignment with network priorities

### Emission Proposals:  
Changes to network economics, including token emission rates, burn mechanisms, and reward distribution parameters.

**Voting Considerations:**
- Long-term economic sustainability
- Impact on token value and inflation
- Effects on network incentives
- Technical feasibility of implementation

### Governance Parameter Changes:
Modifications to voting thresholds, proposal costs, voting periods, and other governance mechanics.

**Voting Considerations:**
- Democratic accessibility vs governance security
- Participation requirements and barriers
- Protection against governance attacks
- Community representation balance

## Voting Mechanics

### Proposal Lifecycle
1. **Submission**: Proposals submitted with required deposit (typically 10,000 TORUS)
2. **Review Period**: Community discussion and feedback (informal)
3. **Voting Period**: 7-day voting window for all token holders
4. **Execution/Rejection**: Automatic execution based on voting results

### Approval Criteria
**Standard Requirements:**
- **Support Threshold**: At least 50% of votes must be favorable
- **Participation Threshold**: More than 10% of total token supply must participate
- **Time Limit**: Voting closes after 7 days regardless of participation

**Outcome Scenarios:**
- **Approved**: 50%+ support + 10%+ participation → Automatic execution
- **Rejected**: Less than 50% support + 10%+ participation → Proposal fails
- **Insufficient Participation**: Less than 10% participation → Proposal expires

### Vote Finality
Once cast, votes cannot be changed during the voting period. This ensures predictability and prevents last-minute manipulation, but requires careful consideration before voting.

## Economic Incentives and Costs

### Proposal Costs
- **Submission Fee**: 10,000 TORUS required to submit proposals
- **Cost Recovery**: Fee refunded if proposal passes, retained by Treasury if rejected
- **Spam Prevention**: Economic barrier prevents frivolous proposals

### Voting Costs
- **Transaction Fees**: Standard network fees apply for voting transactions
- **Power User Setup**: One-time transaction to enable direct voting control
- **Switching Modes**: Small transaction cost to change between delegated and power user modes

## Strategic Voting Considerations

### Information Gathering
- **Proposal Details**: Thoroughly review all proposal documentation
- **Community Discussion**: Engage in Discord, Telegram, and forum discussions
- **Technical Analysis**: Understand implementation details and potential impacts
- **Precedent Setting**: Consider how current votes affect future proposals

### Long-term Impact
- **Network Health**: Vote for proposals that strengthen the ecosystem
- **Economic Sustainability**: Support proposals that enhance long-term value
- **Community Growth**: Favor initiatives that expand and engage the user base
- **Innovation**: Encourage proposals that advance technical capabilities

## Governance Security

### Attack Prevention
- **Proposal Costs**: Economic barriers prevent spam and low-quality submissions
- **Time Delays**: Voting periods allow community review and response
- **Participation Thresholds**: Ensure broad community involvement in decisions
- **Transparent Process**: All votes and outcomes are publicly recorded

### Best Practices
- **Diversified Holdings**: Avoid concentration of voting power in few hands
- **Active Participation**: Regular voting prevents governance capture
- **Community Engagement**: Discuss proposals before voting
- **Long-term Thinking**: Consider ecosystem health over short-term gains
