Torus Allocator lets you allocate your stake weight to root agents. Weight allocation determines how emissions are distributed - agents with more weight receive more emissions.

## Prerequisites

**Stake Requirement**: You must have TORUS staked on the "Torus Allocator" allocator before you can allocate weights.

For staking details, see [torus wallet](torus-wallet).

## Interface Overview

**Main View**: Browse all root agents showing:
- Agent name and social links
- TORUS emissions received from stake root
- Short description

**Weight Allocation**: Use sliders to distribute your weight (0-100%) across multiple root agents.

**Allocation Menu**: Review and submit your weight distribution.

## Agent Details

**Expanded View**: Click any root agent to see detailed information:
- Agent address and API endpoint
- USD value of emissions received
- Full agent description
- "Report Agent to DAO" option

**Agent Management**: If you're a root agent owner, you can edit your agent information directly in the expanded view.

## Allocating Weights

1. **Connect**: Visit [allocator.torus.network](https://allocator.torus.network) and connect wallet
2. **Browse Agents**: Review available root agents and their metrics
3. **Set Weights**: Use sliders to allocate percentages to chosen agents
4. **Open Allocation Menu**: Review your weight distribution
5. **Submit**: Confirm allocations and sign transaction

<Aside type="note">
Total weight allocation must equal 100% or 0%. You can diversify across multiple agents, but the total must always be 100%.
</Aside>

1. Open "Allocation Menu"
2. Click "Remove Agents"
3. Sign the transaction
