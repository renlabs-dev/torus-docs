Emission proposals are a critical governance mechanism that allows TORUS stakeholders to adjust how network fees and emissions are distributed across different components of the ecosystem.

These proposals enable the community to fine-tune economic incentives, adapt to changing network conditions, and optimize the distribution of resources between recycling mechanisms, treasury operations, and various incentive programs.

<Aside type="tip">
**Emission proposals require community consensus** through the governance voting process, ensuring that changes to network economics reflect the collective will of TORUS stakeholders.

## How Emission Proposals Work

Emission proposals allow TORUS stakeholders to configure three key percentage parameters that determine how network fees and emissions are allocated:

### Core Parameters

The three parameters control two separate distribution pools:

**Burn Distribution (up to 100% total):**
- **Recycling Percentage**: Portion of fees that get burned through recycling mechanisms
- **Treasury Percentage**: Portion allocated to the network treasury for operations and development

*Note: Recycling Percentage + Treasury Percentage can be up to 100% total (e.g., 60% combined is valid)*

**Reward Distribution (up to 100% total):**
- **Incentives Ratio**: Portion dedicated to various incentive programs and rewards (independent allocation)

This dual-pool system allows independent control over how much gets burned versus rewarded, with fine-grained control over burn distribution between recycling and treasury.

<Aside type="note">
The dual-pool system provides flexibility in economic tuning. You can independently adjust burn distribution (recycling vs. treasury) and reward allocation (incentives) to optimize network economics based on current conditions.

## Economic Impact

Emission proposals directly affect:

**Network Sustainability**
- Treasury funding for development and operations
- Long-term protocol maintenance and upgrades

**Participant Incentives**
- Rewards for agents, root agents, and other network participants
- Economic motivations for different types of network activity

**Token Economics**
- Supply dynamics through recycling mechanisms
- Distribution patterns across the ecosystem

## Proposal Lifecycle

### 1. Proposal Creation
Community members can submit emission proposals through the DAO interface, specifying the desired percentage allocations for each parameter.

### 2. Community Discussion
Proposals undergo community review and discussion period where stakeholders can analyze the economic implications and provide feedback.

### 3. Voting Period
Any stakeholder with TORUS staked to root agents can vote on the proposal. Voters must become "power voters" by clicking "become a power user" on the proposal screen. Your staked amount becomes your vote weight - if you have 1,000 TORUS staked, your vote weight is 1,000; if you have 10,000 TORUS staked, your vote weight is 10,000.

For a proposal to pass, it must meet two requirements:
- **Majority Support**: More than 50% of votes must be positive
- **Participation Threshold**: Total votes must exceed 10% of all TORUS staked in the network

### 4. Implementation
Approved proposals are automatically implemented on-chain, updating the network's emission distribution parameters.
