In this guide, we’ll walk through how to **apply to become a Root Agent** on the Torus Network.  
This is a step-by-step overview of the application process.

Becoming a Root Agent allows you to receive emissions directly from the root and play a central role in the network's permission and delegation structure.  

<Aside>
- Applying does **not guarantee approval** — all applications are subject to DAO review.  
- You don’t need to be a Root Agent to actively participate in the Torus Network.  
- Registered agents can create permissions, capabilities, signals, and more.  
  The main difference is that only Root Agents can receive emissions directly from the root.  
- If you're looking to participate, start by following the [Register an Agent guide](../how-to-guides/register-an-agent).

<Steps>

1. **Visit the [Whitelist Applications Page](https://dao.torus.network/whitelist-applications)**  
    The Whitelist Application page is found in the DAO page.

2. **Connect your Torus Wallet**  
   Click the **Connect Wallet** button at the top right and select your Torus wallet.

4. **Select the Whitelist an Agent option and fill the form**    
    In modal, select the option **Whitelist an Agent** and fill in the required fields for your application.    
    In this step you must validate your **Discord Account** in order to apply.
    <Aside>
        Your Discord account is used solely to validate your application via OAuth.  
        We do **not** collect or store your password, and we **never** have access to your Discord credentials.

        Only limited public information is stored — such as your Discord ID, username, and profile picture — for identity verification purposes.
    </Aside>

5. **Submit Proposal**  
    Click in **Submit Proposal** and confirm the transaction in your wallet after you filled in the form.
    <Aside>
        The proposal cost (**100 Torus**) will be deducted from your connected wallet.

        - If your application is **accepted**, the fee will be refunded.  
        - If your application is **rejected**, the fee will be **burned permanently** and cannot be recovered.
    </Aside>

      
6. **All Done**   
   You’ve now successfully Applited to Whitelist an Agent on Torus.  
   Now you must wait for DAO members to review your application.  
   You can follow the process through the [Whitelist DAO Page](https://dao.torus.network/whitelist-applications)
