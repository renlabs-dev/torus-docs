## Torus compatibility

Yes, **`torus-cli`** is compatible with the **Torus** library/CLI. However, there are
important considerations to note. **`torus-cli`** verifies the integrity of your
keys, which means that mixing certain types of keys is not permissible.
Specifically, if you possess node keys or other similar types that are not
designed to receive tokens, you will need to relocate them outside of the key
directory.
