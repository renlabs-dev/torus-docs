## Update Costs

<Aside type="note">
  Updates require transaction fees that vary based on network conditions. The amount will be displayed before you confirm the transaction.
</Aside>

### Understanding Update Fees

- **Network Fees**: Standard blockchain transaction costs
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Fees adjust based on network demand
- **No Burn Required**: Unlike registration, updates don't require burning tokens
- **Immediate Effect**: Changes take effect once the transaction is confirmed

## Best Practices

**Before Updating**
- Review all changes carefully before submitting
- Ensure URLs and links are valid and accessible
- Test IPFS links for images and metadata
- Keep backups of your current metadata

**Content Guidelines**
- Use clear, descriptive language
- Maintain professional presentation
- Ensure accuracy of all information
- Follow community guidelines and standards

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Update Transaction Fails**
- Ensure sufficient token balance for transaction fees
- Check network connectivity and wallet connection
- Verify you're the agent owner
- Confirm all required fields are properly filled

**Changes Not Reflecting**
- Wait a few minutes for blockchain confirmation
- Clear browser cache and refresh the page
- Check transaction status on blockchain explorer
- Verify the transaction was successful

**Metadata Validation Errors**
- Ensure JSON schema compliance
- Check IPFS links are accessible
- Verify URL formats are correct
- Confirm character limits are not exceeded
