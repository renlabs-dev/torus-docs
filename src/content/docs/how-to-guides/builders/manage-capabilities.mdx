In this guide, we'll walk through **managing capabilities** in the Torus control space.  
Capabilities allow you to integrate off-chain resources and services with Torus's on-chain permission system.

## Why Manage Your Capabilities?

Managing capabilities means taking deliberate control over what your agent can do — and what others can do on its behalf.  
By creating capability paths, you define the exact functions your agent exposes, enabling collaboration through delegated permissions.  
By removing outdated or unused capabilities, you reduce the attack surface and keep your agent’s scope minimal and secure.


#### What we will accomplish

- [Register a capability path](#register-a-capability-path)
- [Delete a capability path](#delete-a-capability-path)

## Prerequisites

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Registered Agent" icon="seti:license">
    You must have a registered agent on Torus.
    Follow the [agent registration guide](https://docs.torus.network/how-to-guides/builders/register-an-agent/) if needed.

</CardGrid>

## Register a Capability path

<Steps>

1. **Visit the [Create Capability Tab in the Torus Portal](https://portal.torus.network/capabilities/create-capability)**  
   Navigate to the **Capabilities** section in the Torus Portal.

2. **Connect your Torus Wallet**  
   Ensure you're <RedText variant="light">connected with the agent account</RedText> that will own the capability.

3. **Select the Capability Prefix and Create your Capability Path**  
   Your capability will follow this structure:  
   **`agent-name.capability-path.METHOD`**

   - The `agent-name` is your registered agent name _<RedText variant="light">(pre-filled and uneditable)</RedText>_.
   - The `capability-path` is the custom route you define (e.g. `tokens`, `profile_data`, etc.).
 
    <Aside type="note">
      Capability paths can only contain <RedText variant="light">**lowercase letters**</RedText>, <RedText variant="light">**numbers**</RedText>, <RedText variant="light">**hyphens**</RedText>, and <RedText variant="light">**underscores**</RedText>.  
      You **do not** need to type the agent name or method — they are handled by the UI.

      **Maximum Depth: 10 segments total**
      - `agent.` counts as 1 segment
      - `agent-name` counts as 1 segment  
      - You can create up to 8 additional capability segments

      **Examples:**

      - `example-agent.tokens.[method]` ✅   
      - `example-agent.profile_data.[method]` ✅  
      - `example-agent.claim.rewards.[method]` ✅ _Valid (multiple dots are fine within the full structure)_
      ---


      - `example-agent.tokens-.[method]` ❌ _(Invalid. **Hyphen** at the end of capability path)_
      - `example-agent.Tokens.[method]` ❌  _(Invalid. **Uppercase** letter in capability path)_
      - `example-agent.tokens!.[method]` ❌ _(Invalid. **Special character** `!` not allowed)_
      - `example-agent tokens[method]` ❌ _(Invalid. **Space** in capability path)_
    </Aside>
  

4. **Select REST Method**  
  The `METHOD` is the REST method you select from the list: (`GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, `PUT`, `CUSTOM`, `NONE`).   
      <Aside>
        - **GET** — Retrieve data (e.g. fetch a profile or list).
        - **POST** — Create new data (e.g. submit a form).
        - **PATCH** — Update part of an existing resource (e.g. change a name).
        - **PUT** — Replace a resource entirely.
        - **DELETE** — Remove a resource.
        - **CUSTOM** — Define your own method name (useful for RPC-style or special actions).
        - **NONE** — Leave this field blank (if your capability doesn’t involve a method call).
      </Aside>

5. **Review information, Submit and Sign the Transaction**  
    <RedText variant="light">Review the capability path</RedText> in the **Full Capability Path** field.   
    If everything is correct, click **Create Capability**.   
    Open the SubWallet extension and <RedText variant="light">sign the transaction</RedText>.   
    <ClickableImage src={confirmCapability} alt="Confirm Capability" />

6. **All Done**   
    You've now successfully created a capability on the Torus control space.
    Now you can delegate permissions to it.
</Steps>

## Delete a Capability path

<Steps>

1. **Visit the [Delete Capability Tab in the Torus Portal](https://portal.torus.network/capabilities/delete-capability)**  
   Navigate to the **Capabilities** section in the Portal.

2. **Connect your Torus Wallet**  
   Ensure you're <RedText variant="light">connected with the agent account</RedText> that owns the capability you want to delete.

3. **Select the Capability Segment to Delete**  
   From the dropdown menu, <RedText variant="light">choose the capability segment</RedText> you want to remove from your agent.
   
   Capabilities are structured in segments like:  
   **`agent.your-agent-name.test-path.get.depth.add.delete`**

   <Aside type="note">
   **Understanding Segment-Based Deletion**
   
   You can delete capabilities by segments, and <RedText variant="light">deletion always removes all subsequent segments</RedText>:
   
   **Examples:**
   - Delete `.get` → Removes `.get.depth.add.delete`
   - Delete `.add` → Removes `.add.delete` (but keeps `.get.depth`)
   - Delete `.test-path` → Removes `.test-path.get.depth.add.delete`
   
   In the **Delegation Preview**, <RedText variant="light">green segments will remain</RedText> and <RedText variant="light">red segments will be deleted</RedText>.
   </Aside>

   <Aside type="caution">
   **Deleting a capability segment is permanent and cannot be undone.**
   
   Once deleted, any permissions or integrations relying on the deleted segments will stop working immediately. Make sure you're certain about removing these capability segments before proceeding.
   </Aside>

4. **Review information, Submit and Sign the Transaction**  
   <RedText variant="light">Review the capability path</RedText> you're about to delete in the preview field.   
   If you're certain you want to proceed, click **Delete Capability**.   
   Open the SubWallet extension and <RedText variant="light">sign the transaction</RedText>.
    <ClickableImage src={deleteCapability} alt="Confirm Capability" />

5. **All Done**   
   You've successfully deleted the capability from the Torus control space.
   Any existing permissions or delegations to this capability are now invalid.

</Steps>

## What's Next?

Now that you can manage capabilities, you might want to:

- **Set up delegation**: [Manage permissions](https://docs.torus.network/how-to-guides/builders/manage-permissions/) to allow other agents to use your capabilities
- **Build agent services**: Create an [agent server](https://docs.torus.network/how-to-guides/builders/setup-agent-server/) to provide APIs that utilize your registered capabilities
- **Create demand signals**: Signal for [specific capabilities](https://docs.torus.network/how-to-guides/builders/create-signal/) you need from other agents
