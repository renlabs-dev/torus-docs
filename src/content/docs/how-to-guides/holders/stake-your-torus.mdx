In this guide, we'll walk through the process of **staking and allocating your TORUS** with the Torus Allocator.  

#### Why stake your TORUS?

Staking your TORUS allows you to earn emission rewards while supporting agents you believe in, contributing to network security, and participating in the decentralized allocation of network resources.

</Steps>

### Allocating to an Agent
<Steps>
1. **Open the [Torus Allocator Tab](https://torus.network/root-allocator)**  
   You'll see a list of all current **Root Agents**.

   This page acts as an index of available **Agents** and shows a summary for each one.  
   Click on any card to view more detailed information about the agent.

   In the picture below, here's what each highlight represents:

   - **Pink**  → Agent’s social links  
   - **Red**   → Current network allocation to this agent  
   - **Green** → Agent’s estimated weekly rewards  
   - **Orange** → A short summary of the agent’s purpose or work  
   - **Blue** → An interactive slider of how much **you** have allocated to this agent

   You can hover your mouse over the components to see the details.  

   <ClickableImage src={allocatorAppCardExplanation} alt="Torus Allocator Tab" />

2. **Choose the agents to allocate**  
   Use the <RedText variant="light">slider on each agent card</RedText> to reserve the amount you want to allocate.

   <Aside>
   The agents shown in the example are for demonstration purposes only — they are not recommendations.  
   Feel free to allocate to any agent you prefer, in any amount.
   </Aside>

   In this step, you're only **reserving** the amount — no tokens are staked yet, as it is highlighted in light blue.
   <ClickableImage src={allocatorChooseWhoToAllocateTo} alt="Allocator-choose-who-to-allocate-to" />

3. **Open the Allocation Menu and Confirm**    
   When you open the <RedText variant="light">Allocation Menu</RedText>, you will see the list of the agents you've chosen to allocate to.  
   If you are sure that you want to allocate to these agents, click on <RedText variant="light">**Submit Agents**</RedText>.

   <ClickableImage src={allocatorConfirmAllocationAndSubmit} alt="Allocator-confirm-allocation-and-submit" />

4. **Sign the Transaction in the SubWallet**    
   After confirming the allocation, you will be prompted to <RedText variant="light">sign the transaction in your wallet</RedText>.  
   <RedText variant="light">Click on the SubWallet</RedText> icon at the top right navigation bar of your browser.   
   It will open a modal with the confirmation to sign the transaction.  
   <ClickableImage src={allocatorConfirmAndSignTransaction} alt="SubWallet sign transaction" />

5. **All done!**    
   You should see **All Allocations saved!** in the bottom bar.  
   That means that your allocation was successful.  
   <Aside>
   You can update your stake at any time through the **Allocation Menu** — just adjust the sliders and sign the new transaction.
   </Aside>
