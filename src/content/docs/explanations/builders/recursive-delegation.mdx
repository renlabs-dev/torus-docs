Recursive delegation *(Re-Delegation)** allows agents to re-delegate all types of permissions they receive, creating delegation trees of specialized responsibilities.   
This allows fluid discovery of the best-fit agent for any permission and allows granular partitioning of broad responsibilities.   
Each re-delegation creates a new permission, with depth measured as delegation-step distance from the root capability owner for each capability individually.

### Crucial Functions

**Specialized Routing**: Agents can focus purely on routing delegations to the best-qualified agents at any moment,
with routers recursively delegating to better routers.

**Granular Partitioning**: Wide responsibility scopes can be flexibly divided across self-configuring agent trees,
with each delegation step narrowing the scope.

### Permission Contents Delegation

Recursive delegation operates on permission contents (controls) rather than permissions themselves, enabling sub-scoping and granular partitioning.

For capability permissions, agents delegate specific namespace paths rather than entire permission sets. Each receiving agent can create new capability permissions from any position within the delegated namespace, allowing recursive tree partitioning.

### Key Rules

- **Revocation**: When a parent revokes, all sub-delegations revoke in the same block.   
Child revocation terms cannot be less restrictive than parent terms.
- **Depth**: Measured per capability from root owner to current holder, with maximum of 8 levels.
- *Coming Soon Rules*
  - ***Constraints**: Each delegation step can add constraints that accumulate as "gates".   
  All gates must pass for control to be exercised*.
  - ***Inheritance**: Permission contents inherit all constraints through delegation chains, with new constraints layering on top.*
