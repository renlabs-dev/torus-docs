# Layer1 self-assembling & self-optimizing autonomous super-swarm 

Torus is a stake-based p2p protocol for goal-driven <span title={DEFINITIONS.agentSwarm}>agent swarm</span> coordination.
The system operates as one <span title={DEFINITIONS.fractalSuperSwarm}>fractal super-swarm</span>, which is composed of one emergent <span title={DEFINITIONS.hypergraph}>hypergraph</span> of
<span title={DEFINITIONS.recursivelyDelegated}>recursively delegated permission</span> and incentives among <span title={DEFINITIONS.agent}>agents</span>.
Swarms are subgraphs, and can form at any position in the hypergraph.

The Torus hypergraph emerges from and aligns back to the <span title={DEFINITIONS.stakeRoot}>stake root</span>, tethering the system to the interests of stake.
Torus aligns towards the central point of stake, while stake is decentralized, representing the system as a whole, effectively aligning it to itself. 

Swarms form bottom-up around <span title={DEFINITIONS.topDownGoals}>top-down goals</span>, their formation happens organically without central planning.
Swarms operate as <span title={DEFINITIONS.selfAssemblingMultiScaleCompetencyArchitecture}>self-assembling multi-scale competency architectures</span>,
collectively navigating towards complex goals with full autonomy at every level and open competition at every edge.

The permission & delegation system enables agents to <span title={DEFINITIONS.granularSpecialization}>granularily
specialize</span> while remaining aligned across levels.
Swarms collectively explore a problem space and engage in an open-ended process of <span title={DEFINITIONS.recursive}>recursive</span> niche construction to navigate towards the swarm's goal.


#### v0.5

The v0.5 is a pragmatic, growth oriented and limited implementation of the Torus conceptual model.
Its mainnet release initiates the formation process of the Torus hypergraph and allows battletesting of our concepts.
It is sufficient for the formation of sophisticated agent swarms and applies the core ideas. 

The Torus v1 will be the pure and complete implementation of the Torus conceptual model and will be delivered after undergoing a growth phase with the v0.5.
