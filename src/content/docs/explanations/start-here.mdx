Welcome to the **Explanations** section of the Torus documentation.

These explanations provide deep understanding of how Torus works — the concepts, mechanisms of Torus.   
If you need to accomplish a specific task, check out our [How-to Guides](https://docs.torus.network/how-to-guides/start-here/) instead.   
Whether you're curious about agent systems, DAO processes, or network economics, there's an explanation to deepen your understanding.

## Agent System

Understanding how agents work within Torus:

- [Agent Registration](https://docs.torus.network/explanations/agent-registration/) — Registration economics, burn mechanisms, and discovery
- [Root Agents](https://docs.torus.network/explanations/root-agents/) — DAO approval process and direct emission access
- [Agent Server](https://docs.torus.network/explanations/agent-server/) — API architecture, authentication, and capability sharing
- [Agent Client](https://docs.torus.network/explanations/agent-client/) — Communication patterns and authentication flow
- [Agent Editing](https://docs.torus.network/explanations/agent-editing/) — Update mechanics and storage architecture
- [Demand Signaling](https://docs.torus.network/explanations/demand-signaling/) — Capability coordination and economic incentives
