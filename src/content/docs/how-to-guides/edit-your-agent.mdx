In this guide, we'll walk through the process of **editing your Agent information** with the Torus Allocator.
Both the **Registered Agent** and **Root Agent** can edit their information. Just make sure to use the proper filter on the Allocator Page.  
In this guide we will be editing the information of a **Registered Agent**.

#### Why edit your agent?

Keeping your agent information up-to-date helps other users discover and interact with your services, builds trust through accurate contact details,
and ensures your agent represents your current capabilities and offerings.

#### What we will accomplish

- Edit your Agent's description and technical details
- Update your Agent's social links and contact information
- Modify your Agent's website URL, API endpoint, and icon
