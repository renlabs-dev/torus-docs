The Wallet scope enables cold-hot wallet behavior, where high-value accounts can delegate specific 
operations to more accessible accounts without exposing private keys.    
This significantly improves security by allowing cold storage accounts to remain offline while still participating in network staking activities.

### Core Functions

* **Cold-Hot Wallet Architecture:** High-value accounts can delegate operational permissions while keeping primary keys in cold storage, eliminating the security-convenience tradeoff.
* **Granular Operation Control:** Specific wallet operations can be delegated independently, allowing precise control over what delegated accounts can perform.
* **Non-Transferable Delegation:** Delegated operations cannot access or transfer the principal funds, maintaining asset security even if hot wallets are compromised.

#### Rules

* **Operation Scoping:** Each delegation specifies exactly which wallet operations are permitted, preventing scope creep.
* **Principal Protection:** Delegated accounts cannot perform operations that would reduce the principal balance or transfer core assets.
* **Revocation Terms:** Can be configured as revocable or irrevocable.
* **Constraint Inheritance:** Security constraints from the cold wallet apply to all delegated operations, ensuring consistent security policies.
* **Time-bound Delegation:** Delegations can include expiration times for automatic security cleanup.

#### Active Delegation Behavior

When a wallet permission delegation is active, the delegator can choose the level of operational control:

* **Optional Exclusive Access:** The delegator can choose whether to retain direct control alongside the recipient through the exclusive access parameter
* **Recipient Authority:** The designated recipient can perform the specific wallet operations covered by the permission
* **Asset Constraints:** All operations are constrained to existing assets, meaning no new staking from available balance
