Welcome to the **Explanations** section of the Torus documentation.

These explanations provide deep understanding of how Torus works — the concepts, mechanisms of Torus.   
If you need to accomplish a specific task, check out our [How-to Guides](https://docs.torus.network/how-to-guides/start-here/) instead.   
Whether you're curious about agent systems, DAO processes, or network economics, there's an explanation to deepen your understanding.

## Agent System

Understanding how agents work within Torus:

- [Agent Registration](https://docs.torus.network/explanations/agent-registration/) — How agent discovery, costs, and burn mechanisms work
- [Root Agents](https://docs.torus.network/explanations/root-agents/) — DAO approval process, community requirements, and emission access
- Agent Server _(coming soon)_
- Agent Client _(coming soon)_
- Managing Your Agent _(coming soon)_
