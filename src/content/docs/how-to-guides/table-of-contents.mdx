Welcome to the **How-to Guides** section of the Torus documentation.

These guides are focused, practical, and designed to help you achieve specific outcomes within the Torus ecosystem, without distractions or deep dives into theory.   
If you prefer to start with the theory first, begin with [Explanations](https://docs.torus.network/explanations/table-of-contents) and continue from there.   
Whether you're here to use Torus, build on it, or coordinate its evolution, there's a guide to get you there.
