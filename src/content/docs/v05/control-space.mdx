### Control Space

The **control space** is the set of all **controls** that are integrated with the **Torus permission system**. **Controls** are discrete units of delegable authority over onchain & offchain capabilities. 

The **control space** is the total scope of power & capability of the Torus organism. The space of all things that Torus can control, utilize and optimize.

The **chain control space** consists of all parameters & storages, while the **offchain control space** consists of all agent endpoints that were registered into the Torus namespace, integrating them with the permission system. 

### Namespace

The **namespace** serves as a registry that maps identifiers (names) to offchain endpoints (agent capabilities). The namespace is powerful as a registry, because it allows descriptive names instead of meaningless IDs. 

The namespace has a hierarchical tree structure, enabling the organization of those identifiers, and the ability to delegate permissions over namespace paths, rather than just individual identifiers. This means, you can delegate permission over a higher-level branch and automatically include all the sub-branches. This increases the usage efficiency of permissions.

The namespace is designed to be applied beyond offchain agent capabilities in the future, allowing to represent swarm-owned assets, emission streams and any other resources integrated with Torus.

### Namespace structure

Namespaces establish a dot-separated hierarchical tree structure.

Consider the namespace `agent.alice.memory.twitter`—this path encodes a clear hierarchical relationship:
- `agent`: The root domain for all agent-related capabilities
- `agent.alice`: Alice's autonomous capability domain  
- `agent.alice.memory`: Memory-related service specialization
- `agent.alice.memory.twitter`: Specific Twitter memory service instantiation

Each namespace segment must conform to strict validation rules that ensure global consistency:
- Character set: lowercase letters, digits, hyphens, underscores only
- Boundary constraints: must begin and end with alphanumeric characters
- Length bounds: 1–63 characters per segment
- Pattern: `^[a-z0-9]([a-z0-9-_]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?`

### Control Instantiation & Lifecycle

When an agent wants to integrate a capability with Torus, they have to register a corresponding namespace. Conveniently, registering `agent.alice.memory.twitter` atomically instantiates any missing parent namespaces (`agent.alice`, `agent.alice.memory`) within a single transaction.

Once established, the agent can use the permission delegation system for cooperation and commerce around the capability. Namespace deletion requires the absence of active delegations, preventing disruption of dependent economic structure.

### Permission Delegation & Emergence

The true power of namespaces lies in their integration with the permission delegation system. Agents can granularly & recursively delegate access to specific controls derived from their namespaces, with flexible constraints.

This enables sophisticated patterns: Alice might delegate time-bounded read access to `agent.alice.memory.twitter` while retaining write permissions, or establish multi-signature revocation requirements that involve third-party arbiters.
