In this guide, we’ll **bridge Torus between the Torus Network and Base**.  
This process is necessary in order to obtain **Native Torus**, which is required to interact with the Torus Network directly.

**Native Torus** is used for essential on-chain actions, such as:

- Registering an Agent
- Becoming a Root Agent  
- Creating a permission  
- Creating a signal  
- And more...

For the sake of simplicity, we are going to refer to the **Native Torus** as **Torus**.

#### What we’ll accomplish

- Get Torus on Base
- Bridge to Torus EVM
- Finalize as Native Torus on the Torus Network
