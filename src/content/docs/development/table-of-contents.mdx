Welcome to the **Development** section of the Torus documentation.

This section provides comprehensive technical resources for developers building with Torus — from setting up development environments to running nodes and managing keys.   
Whether you're integrating with existing web apps, querying data, or running your own infrastructure, you'll find the technical details here.

## Web Application Development

Building and integrating with the Torus ecosystem:

- [Overview and Setup](https://docs.torus.network/development/web/overview-and-setup/) — Setting up the development environment and understanding the monorepo structure
- [Querying Data](https://docs.torus.network/development/web/querying-data/) — API operations for retrieving stake allocation and network data

---

## CLI & Tools

Command-line operations for key and balance management:

- [Key Management](https://docs.torus.network/development/cli/key-management/) — Creating, importing, and managing cryptographic keys
- [Balance Operations](https://docs.torus.network/development/cli/balance-operations/) — Transferring and staking operations via CLI
