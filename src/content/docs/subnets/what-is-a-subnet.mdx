description: Learn what a subnet is in the Torus Network.

Subnets are distinct incentive environments running in parallel on the Torus protocol. Each is unique based on a set of characteristic defined by its consensus, parameters and validation methodology.

Every subnet, with the consensus of **yuma**, has a founder who has control over its parameters while driving its development.

Miners compete around subnet emissions, while subnets compete around protocol emissions.
