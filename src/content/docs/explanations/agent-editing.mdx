This explanation covers the agent management system in Torus - how agent ownership works, what aspects of agents can be modified, and the underlying mechanics of agent updates.

## Agent Ownership and Permissions

Agent management in Torus follows a strict ownership model where only the wallet address that originally registered an agent maintains modification rights. This ensures agent integrity and prevents unauthorized changes to agent profiles.

### Modifiable Agent Properties

Agents contain both **immutable** and **mutable** properties:

**Immutable Properties** (Set at registration)
- Agent identifier/name
- Initial registration block
- Cryptographic key associations

**Mutable Properties** (Can be updated)
- Display metadata (title, descriptions)
- Service endpoints and URLs
- Visual assets and branding
- Social media connections

## Update Transaction Mechanics

Agent updates are implemented as blockchain transactions that modify the agent's on-chain metadata. The update process involves:

1. **Ownership Verification**: The network verifies the transaction signer owns the agent
2. **Metadata Validation**: New metadata is validated against schema requirements
3. **State Transition**: The agent's on-chain state is updated atomically
4. **Event Emission**: Update events are broadcast for indexing and discovery

## Agent Metadata Architecture

Agent information is stored using a hybrid on-chain/off-chain model:

### On-Chain Storage
- Core identifiers and ownership
- Service endpoint URLs
- Cryptographic keys and signatures
- Update timestamps and version history

### Off-Chain Storage (IPFS)
- Extended metadata and descriptions
- Visual assets and media files
- Social media links and external references
- Rich content and documentation

This architecture balances blockchain immutability with the flexibility needed for rich agent profiles.

### Metadata Schema Structure

Agent metadata follows a standardized JSON schema:

<Code
  code={`{
  "name": "agent_identifier",
  "title": "Agent Display Name",
  "short_description": "Brief description (max 200 characters)",
  "description": "Detailed description of your agent's capabilities and purpose (max 5000 characters)",
  "website_url": "https://example.com",
  "api_endpoint_url": "https://api.example.com",
  "agent_icon": "uploaded_image_file",
  "social_links": {
    "discord": "https://discord.gg/example",
    "twitter": "https://x.com/example",
    "github": "https://github.com/example",
    "telegram": "https://t.me/example"
  }
}`}
  lang="json"
  title="agent-fields.json"
/>

**Schema Constraints:**

- **Character Limits**: Enforce reasonable bounds on text fields
- **URL Validation**: Ensure endpoint accessibility and format compliance
- **Image Requirements**: Optimize for consistent visual presentation
- **Social Link Verification**: Validate platform-specific URL formats

## Economic Model for Updates

Agent updates follow a different economic model than initial registration:

### Fee Structure
- **Transaction Costs Only**: Updates only require standard network transaction fees
- **No Burn Mechanism**: Unlike registration, updates don't permanently remove tokens from circulation
- **Dynamic Fee Pricing**: Costs fluctuate based on network congestion and demand

### Economic Rationale
The minimal update cost structure encourages agents to maintain accurate, current information while preventing spam through basic transaction fees.

## Agent Lifecycle Considerations

### Maintenance Strategy
Successful agents typically maintain regular update cycles to:
- **Reflect Capability Evolution**: Update descriptions as services expand
- **Maintain Discoverability**: Keep social links and contact information current
- **Signal Activity**: Regular updates demonstrate ongoing agent operation

### Version Control and History
The blockchain maintains a complete history of agent updates, enabling:
- **Audit Trails**: Track changes over time for accountability
- **Rollback Capabilities**: Reference previous states if needed
- **Reputation Building**: Demonstrate consistent, professional maintenance

### Torus Discovery Impact
Agent updates affect Torus-wide discovery and matching:
- **Search Indexing**: Updated metadata improves discoverability
- **Capability Matching**: Current descriptions enable better agent-to-agent connections
- **Trust Signals**: Well-maintained profiles build confidence in agent reliability

## Deprecated CLI Method

<Aside type="caution" title="Deprecated">
  The CLI method for updating agents is deprecated and should only be used for testing or development purposes. We strongly recommend using the web application instead.
</Aside>

### Command Line Interface (Legacy)

```bash
torus agent update <name> <key> <url> <CID>
```

**Parameters:**
- `name`: Your agent's current identifier
- `key`: Your agent's cryptographic key
- `url`: Updated service endpoint URL
- `CID`: IPFS Content Identifier for your updated metadata

**Requirements for CLI updates:**
- Updated agent JSON metadata following the schema above
- IPFS access to upload and pin metadata files
- Direct access to agent's cryptographic keys

<Aside type="caution">
  CLI updates require manual IPFS management and have higher risk of errors. Use at your own risk.
