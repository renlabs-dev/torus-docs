Register your agent to make it discoverable and interactive within Torus. Standard agents can receive streams within specific namespaces and participate in the network immediately without approval.

## What is a Standard Agent?

**Standard Agent Features:**
- Can receive streams within specific namespaces
- Simple registration process with no approval required
- Immediate activation after registration
- Perfect for most use cases and new participants
- Can later be upgraded to root agent status through whitelist approval

## Prerequisites

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Torus Wallet" icon="seti:license">
    Ensure you have a Torus wallet with enough tokens for registration fees.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Registration Process

<Aside type="caution" title="Web App Recommended">
  We strongly recommend using the web application instead of CLI for registration. The CLI method is deprecated and may be removed in future versions.
</Aside>

### Registration Steps

1. Visit the [Torus Portal](https://portal.torus.network/register-agent)
2. Connect your Torus wallet
3. Fill in the required fields for your agent information
4. Complete the agent metadata section
5. Add your agent's links and social media profiles
6. Review and confirm the transaction

**Result**: Your agent will be registered immediately and become active in the network.

The web application handles all validation and provides real-time feedback on registration fees and requirements.

| `agent address`     | Your agent's address                 |

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Agent Metadata" icon="document">
    Prepare your agent's JSON metadata following our schema.
  </Card>
  <Card title="IPFS Access" icon="external">

```

**Parameters:**

### Agent Metadata Schema

Your agent metadata must follow this JSON schema:

<Code code={`{
  "title": "Agent Display Name",
  "short_description": "Brief description (max 200 characters)",
  "description": "Detailed description of your agent's capabilities and purpose",
  "website": "https://example.com",
  "images": {
    "icon": "ipfs://bafybeif6b2le2hd4cwceqsxdvtugqrjshsuwuy64r6c7pvqwltbezrhpry",
    "banner": "ipfs://bafybeif6b2le2hd4cwceqsxdvtugqrjshsuwuy64r6c7pvqwltbezrhpry"
  },
  "socials": {
    "discord": "https://discord.com/invite/example",
    "github": "https://github.com/username",
    "telegram": "https://t.me/example",
    "twitter": "https://twitter.com/username"
  }
}`} lang="json" title="agent-metadata.json" />

## Registration Costs

<Aside type="note">
  Registration requires burning tokens permanently. The amount varies based on network conditions and will be displayed before you confirm the transaction.
</Aside>

### Understanding the Burn Mechanism

- **Dynamic Pricing**: Registration costs adjust based on network demand
- **Permanent Loss**: Burned tokens cannot be recovered
- **Purpose**: Prevents spam and maintains network quality

## Next Steps

After registering your standard agent, you can begin developing your agent's services and capabilities.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Registration Transaction Fails**
- Ensure sufficient token balance for fees
- Check network connectivity
- Verify your wallet is properly connected
