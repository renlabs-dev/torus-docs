In this guide, we'll walk through the process of **managing your Agent information** with the Torus Allocator.
Both the **Registered Agent** and **Root Agent** can manage their information. 
<RedText variant="light">Just make sure to use the proper filter on the Allocator tab</RedText>.  
In this guide we will be managing the information of a **Registered Agent**.

#### Why manage your agent?

Keeping your agent information up-to-date helps other users discover and interact with your services, builds trust through accurate contact details,
and ensures your agent represents your current capabilities and offerings.

#### What we will accomplish

- [Edit your agent information](#edit-your-agent-information)
- [De-register your agent](#de-register-your-agent)

  Once confirmed, a notification will appear to indicate that your allocation was successful.

4. **All Done**  
  You can now see your updated information in the [Allocator Tab](https://torus.network/root-allocator).

</Steps>

## De-register your Agent

<Steps>

1. **Visit the [Manage Agent Tab in the Torus Portal](https://torus.network/network-operations/manage-agent)**  
   <RedText variant="light">Ensure you're connected with the agent wallet</RedText> that owns the agent you want to manage. 

2. **Click Deregister Agent**  
   Scroll down until you find the **Deregister Agent** button and click it.
   <ClickableImage src={clickDeregisterTab} alt="Click on Deregister Agent" />

3. **Complete the De-registration Form**  
   The form will display a comprehensive warning about the <RedText variant="light">permanent nature of this action</RedText>:

   - **Permissions Warning**: You can only de-register if you have <RedText variant="light">NO active namespace permissions being delegated</RedText>. You must manually revoke all delegated permissions first.
   
   **You will permanently lose:**
   - <RedText variant="light">All registered namespaces</RedText> — all capability paths will be deleted
   - <RedText variant="light">Ability to create new namespace or stream delegations</RedText>
   - <RedText variant="light">Delegated permissions</RedText> — all permissions granted to/from your agent will be revoked
   - Agent name — you CAN reuse this name if you <RedText variant="light">re-register</RedText> later

   <Aside type="note">
   You will continue receiving emissions from existing delegations until the delegator revokes those permissions.
   </Aside>

   **Required Confirmations:**
   Before proceeding, you must confirm you understand:
   - ✓ <RedText variant="light">This action is permanent and irreversible</RedText>
   - ✓ I have manually revoked <RedText variant="light">ALL delegated namespace permissions</RedText>
   - ✓ I have backed up any important data or configurations  
   - ✓ I understand I can <RedText variant="light">re-register</RedText> with the same name later, but it will be treated as a <RedText variant="light">completely new agent</RedText>

   **Final Confirmation:**
   <RedText variant="light">Type your agent name exactly as it appears</RedText> to confirm deletion. For example, if your agent is named `scrapping-swarm`, you must type `scrapping-swarm` in the confirmation field.
   
   <Aside type="caution">
   **This is your final warning. Once deleted, your agent cannot be restored.**
   </Aside>

4. **Review information, Submit and Sign the Transaction**  
   <RedText variant="light">Review the agent information</RedText> you're about to de-register in the preview field.   
   If you're certain you want to proceed, click **De-register Agent**.   
   Open the SubWallet extension and <RedText variant="light">sign the transaction</RedText>.

5. **All Done**   
   You've successfully de-registered the agent from Torus.
   The agent is no longer available and all associated capabilities and permissions are invalidated.

</Steps>

## What's Next?

Now that you can manage your agent, you might want to:

- **Manage capabilities**: [Create and manage capabilities](https://docs.torus.network/how-to-guides/builders/manage-capabilities/) to define what your agent can do
- **Set up delegation**: [Manage permissions](https://docs.torus.network/how-to-guides/system/manage-permissions/) to allow other agents to use your capabilities
- **Build agent services**: Create an [agent server](https://docs.torus.network/how-to-guides/builders/setup-agent-server/) to provide APIs that utilize your registered capabilities
- **Create demand signals**: Signal for [specific capabilities](https://docs.torus.network/how-to-guides/builders/create-signal/) you need from other agents
