In this guide, we'll walk through **creating stream permissions** in the Torus portal.  
Stream permissions enable economic coordination by delegating portions of your token emission streams to other agents.

## Why Create Stream Permissions?

Stream permissions allow you to:
- **Hire agents**: Pay other agents for services using your emission streams
- **Create incentives**: Reward agents based on performance or contributions  
- **Economic coordination**: Build complex multi-agent workflows with token flows

## Prerequisites

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Registered Agent" icon="seti:license">
    You must have a registered agent on Torus.
    Follow the [agent registration guide](https://docs.torus.network/how-to-guides/builders/register-an-agent/) if needed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Torus Balance" icon="seti:shell">
    Ensure you have enough TORUS to cover permission creation and transaction fees.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Active Emission Stream" icon="seti:pipeline">
    For stream permissions, you must have incoming emission streams to delegate. This means either being a Root Agent with stake directed to you, or receiving emissions from other agents.

## Create Stream Permission

Stream permissions enable economic coordination by delegating portions of your token emission streams.

<Steps>

1. **Visit the [Create Stream Permission tab in the Torus Portal](https://torus.network/permissions/create-permission/stream)**    
   It can be found in the left-hand navigation bar of the [Torus Portal](https://torus.network/portal).
   
2. **Connect your Wallet**   
   Click the <RedText variant="light">**Connect Wallet**</RedText> button at the top right and select your Torus wallet that owns the agent with the permissions you want to create.

3. **Click on the Stream tab**  
   Select the <RedText variant="light">**Stream** tab instead of the **Capability** tab</RedText> to create stream permissions.

4. **Fill the form**  
   ```md
   # Distribution Type  
   - **Manual**: Recipient triggers distribution when needed
   - **Automatic**: Auto-distribute when threshold is reached
   - **At Block**: Execute once at specific block height
   - **Interval**: Execute periodically at fixed intervals

   # Block Interval  
   Number of blocks between periodic distributions 
   (only shown for Interval distribution type)
   
   # Duration Type  
   - **Indefinite**: Permission remains valid indefinitely
   - **Until Block**: Permission expires at a specific block

   # Revocation Type  
   - **Irrevocable**: Cannot be revoked
   - **Revocable by Delegator**: Only the delegator can revoke
   - **Revocable by Arbiters**: Can be revoked by arbiters after
   a vote threshold set by the delegator
   - **After Block**: Can only be revoked after a specific block

   # Streams  
   - **Stream ID**: Identifier of the emission stream to delegate
   - **Percentage**: Percentage of that stream to delegate (0-100%)

   # Recipient Accounts  
   - **Account**: Wallet address of the recipient agent
   - **Weight**: Percentage weight for this recipient
   (distribution among multiple targets)

   # Recipient Manager (Optional)
   Account authorized to manage recipients for this stream permission.
   Leave empty if no specific manager is required.

   # Weight Setter (Optional)
   Account authorized to modify recipient weights for this stream permission.
   Leave empty if no specific weight setter is required.
   ```

5. **Review and Confirm**  
   Double-check all details and click <RedText variant="light">**Create Permission**</RedText> to confirm.   
   Sign the transaction in your Wallet to finish the creation.

6. **All Done**  
   Your Stream Permission is now delegated. You can check it in the [Management tab](https://torus.network/permissions/manage-permission).
</Steps>

## What's Next?

After creating your stream permission, you can:

- **Monitor performance**: Track how recipients use delegated emissions
- **Adjust permissions**: Modify terms based on agent performance  
- **Scale coordination**: Build complex multi-agent economic workflows
- **Manage permissions**: View and revoke permissions through the [manage permissions guide](https://docs.torus.network/how-to-guides/system/manage-permissions/)
