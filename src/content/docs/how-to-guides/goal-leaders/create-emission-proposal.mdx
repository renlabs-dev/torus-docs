In this guide, we’ll walk through **submitting an emission proposal** via the Torus DAO.

## Prerequisites

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="TORUS Balance" icon="seti:license">
    You need at least 10 000 TORUS in your wallet to create proposals.  
    See [how to get TORUS](https://docs.torus.network/how-to-guides/holders/bridge-from-base/).

## Create an Emission Proposal

<Steps>

1. **Visit the [Torus DAO Proposals tab](https://dao.torus.network/proposals)**  
   Navigate to the DAO proposals page where you can view existing proposals and create new ones.

2. **Connect your Wallet**  
   Click the <RedText variant="light">**Connect Wallet**</RedText> button and ensure you're connected with a wallet that has at least 10,000 TORUS.

3. **Click on Shape the Network**  
   Look for the <RedText variant="light">"Shape the Network" button</RedText>, it is at the top right corner of the dashboard.

4. **Select "Create Emission Proposal" Type**  
   In the modal, choose <RedText variant="light">**"Create emission proposal"**</RedText> from the available options.  
   This is similar to the whitelisting process but focuses on network economics.

5. **Configure Emission Parameters**  
   Set the three key percentage parameters across two distribution pools:
   
   **Burn Distribution (up to 100% total):**
   - **Recycling Percentage**: <RedText variant="light">Portion of fees burned through recycling</RedText>
   - **Treasury Percentage**: <RedText variant="light">Portion allocated to network treasury</RedText>
   
   **Reward Distribution (up to 100% total):**
   - **Incentives Ratio**: <RedText variant="light">Portion for incentive programs and rewards</RedText>
   
   <Aside type="caution">
      **Parameter Requirements**
      
      - Recycling + Treasury percentages can be up to 100% total (e.g., 30% + 40% = 70% is valid)
      - Incentives Ratio is a separate allocation up to 100% for rewards
      - This dual-pool system controls burn vs. reward distribution independently
   </Aside>

6. **Add Proposal Details**  
   Provide comprehensive information about your proposal:
   
   - **Title**: Clear, descriptive name for the proposal
   - **Description**: Detailed explanation of the economic rationale, why these specific percentages benefit the network...
   
7. **Review and Submit**  
   Double-check all parameters and details before submission. Click <RedText variant="light">**"Submit Proposal"**</RedText> and <RedText variant="light">confirm the transaction in your wallet</RedText>.

8. **Share with the community**  
   After submitting, post your proposal in Discord, Telegram, or other channels to spark discussion and encourage voting.  
   <Aside type="note">
     A proposal isn’t final until voting ends and it’s executed on‑chain (or rejected).  
     Each proposal remains open for 7 days; if it doesn’t meet the approval criteria within that window, it closes automatically.  
     To try again, you must repeat the process (including the 10,000 TORUS fee).
   </Aside>

9. **All done when either**    
   - The 7‑day voting window ends.  
   - ≥ 50 % support & > 10 % participation: proposal executes on‑chain.  
   - ≤ 50 % support & > 10 % participation: proposal get denied.   

   Therefore, make sure to follow the voting process closely.




</Steps>
