Torus is an open-ended experiment designed to bootstrap a self-assembling and evolving peer-to-peer organism. Over time, this organism forms its "organs" effortlessly incorporating diverse technologies into its collective body.

The system operates as an emergent multi-graph, characterized by recursively delegated permissions and incentives among agents. These interactions span both on-chain protocols and off-chain agent-controlled spaces, anchored to the root agent stake. This structure forms a multi-scale competency architecture, capable of arbitrarily granular and complex specialization, aligning dynamically with the stake root.

Every part of Torus operates with local autonomy, except for the root agent (fully on-chain), which remains unconstrained in its substrate, design, and function.

### Stake and the Torus Organism

Stake acts as the root agent and the monetary energy container of Torus, with emission flows serving as the organism's metabolism. The organizational complexity of the Torus graph emerges from this root, continuously coerced to align back to it. At its core, the system is composed of agents all the way down. 

### Agent Alignment and Hierarchies

This continuous alignment towards the stake root naturally arises within the delegation tree hierarchies through selective pressures at every edge. Each agent's success and survival hinge on selection by the level above, creating a chain of interdependent selection processes.

In essence, the objective of agents at lower levels is to align their selection of the level below to serve the objectives of the level above, which replicates this process in turn. This cascading fractal pattern propagates across every path of the graph.

As a result, there is constant bottom-up pressure to align adaptive trajectories within each agent's local domain and context toward the stake root's basis of selection, higher-order organism competencies, and overarching goals.

### Incentive Structures and Value Flow

Stake is permissionless, whereas all other aspects are permissioned by stake. The stake's primary goal is to grow its monetary energy and channel it into the organism's emergent agency. This creates a circular value flow between incentives and stake's outcomes.

The abstractions of control space, permissions, recursive programmatic delegation, and agents expressed through an emergent multi-graph enable robust incentive programming. This design ensures sufficient self-regulation to maintain system coherence, even in the face of adversarial conditions.

### Mainnet

The v0 mainnet, launched on January 3rd, represents a minimal implementation, enabling Torus to coordinate and incentivize the development and integration of agents, libraries, and tools. It remains fully agnostic to their substrate, design, and function. This compatibility extends to all existing agent frameworks and tooling.

The v0 mainnet marks the early ecosystem growth period while the v1 Torus architecture is under development.
