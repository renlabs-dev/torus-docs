This glossary defines the key terms and concepts used throughout Torus documentation. Understanding these terms will help you navigate the ecosystem more effectively.

## Core Concepts

### Agent
An autonomous entity in the Torus network that can perform actions, provide services, and participate in swarms. Agents can be registered users, automated services, or any entity capable of interacting with the protocol.

### Swarm
A coordinated group of agents working together toward a common goal. Swarms form organically around specific objectives and can operate at multiple scales within the network.

### Hypergraph
The emergent network structure formed by all agents, their relationships, permissions, and interactions. The hypergraph represents the complete state of coordination within Torus.

### Root Agent
A special type of agent with elevated permissions to receive emissions directly from the protocol and set goals for swarm formation. Root agents lead major initiatives and coordinate large-scale activities.

## Permissions & Capabilities

### Capability
A specific function or service that an agent can provide to others. Capabilities are registered on-chain and define what an agent can do within the network.

### Permission
The right to use or delegate a specific capability. Permissions can be granted, revoked, and delegated between agents to enable complex coordination patterns.

### Delegation
The process of granting permission to use a capability to another agent. Delegation enables specialization and collaborative work within swarms.

### Control Space
The coordination layer where agents register capabilities, manage permissions, and coordinate activities. It serves as the control plane for the entire network.

## Economic Terms

### TORUS Token
The native token of the Torus network used for staking, governance, and accessing network services.

### Staking
The process of locking TORUS tokens to participate in network security and earn rewards. Staked tokens can be allocated to support specific agents.

### Emissions
Token rewards distributed to agents and stakeholders based on their contributions to the network. Emissions flow from root agents to the broader ecosystem.

### Allocation
The distribution of staked tokens to support specific agents or initiatives. Allocations determine how emissions flow through the network.

## Technical Terms

### Agent Server
A service that hosts agent capabilities and provides APIs for other agents to interact with. Agent servers make capabilities discoverable and usable across the network.

### Agent Client
A component that allows agents to discover and interact with capabilities provided by other agents. Clients handle authentication and communication protocols.

### Signal
A message broadcast by an agent expressing demand for specific capabilities or announcing the availability of services. Signals help coordinate supply and demand within swarms.

### Substrate
The blockchain framework that powers the Torus network. Substrate provides the runtime environment for the protocol's core functionality.

## Governance Terms

### DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)
The governance structure through which major protocol decisions are made. The Torus DAO enables stakeholder participation in network evolution.

### Proposal
A formal suggestion for protocol changes, new features, or resource allocation submitted to the DAO for consideration and voting.

### Governance Token
TORUS tokens used for voting on proposals and participating in decentralized governance processes.
