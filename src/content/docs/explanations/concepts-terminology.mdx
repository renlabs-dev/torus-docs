  // Core Concepts
  agent: `An autonomous entity in Torus that can perform actions, provide services, 
    and participate in swarms. Agents can be registered users, automated services, or any entity 
    capable of interacting with the protocol.`,
  
  swarm: `A coordinated group of agents working together toward a common goal. Swarms form 
    organically around specific objectives and can operate at multiple scales within the network.`,
  
  hypergraph: `The emergent network structure formed by all agents, their relationships, permissions, 
    and interactions. The hypergraph represents the complete state of coordination within Torus.`,
  
  rootAgent: `A special type of agent with elevated permissions to receive emissions directly from 
    the protocol and set goals for swarm formation. Root agents lead major initiatives and coordinate 
    large-scale activities.`,
  
  // Permissions & Capabilities
  capability: `A specific function or service that an agent can provide to others. Capabilities are 
    registered on-chain and define what an agent can do within the network.`,
  
  permission: `The right to use or delegate a specific capability. Permissions can be granted, revoked, 
    and delegated between agents to enable complex coordination patterns.`,
  
  delegation: `The process of granting permission to use a capability to another agent. Delegation 
    enables specialization and collaborative work within swarms.`,
  
  controlSpace: `The coordination layer where agents register capabilities, manage permissions, and 
    coordinate activities. It serves as the control plane for the entire network.`,
  
  // Economic Terms
  torusToken: `The native token of Torus used for staking, governance, and accessing 
    network services.`,
  
  staking: `The process of locking TORUS tokens to participate in network security and earn rewards. 
    Staked tokens can be allocated to support specific agents.`,
  
  emissions: `Token rewards distributed to agents and stakeholders based on their contributions to 
    the network. Emissions flow from root agents to the broader ecosystem.`,
  
  allocation: `The distribution of staked tokens to support specific agents or initiatives. Allocations 
    determine how emissions flow through the network.`,
  
  // Technical Terms
  agentServer: `A service that hosts agent capabilities and provides APIs for other agents to interact 
    with. Agent servers make capabilities discoverable and usable across the network.`,
  
  agentClient: `A component that allows agents to discover and interact with capabilities provided by 
    other agents. Clients handle authentication and communication protocols.`,
  
  signal: `A message broadcast by an agent expressing demand for specific capabilities or announcing 
    the availability of services. Signals help coordinate supply and demand within swarms.`,
  
  substrate: `The blockchain framework that powers Torus. Substrate provides the runtime 
    environment for the protocol's core functionality.`,
  
  // Governance Terms
  dao: `The governance structure through which major protocol decisions are made. Torus DAO 
    enables stakeholder participation in network evolution.`,
  
  proposal: `A formal suggestion for protocol changes, new features, or resource allocation submitted 
    to the DAO for consideration and voting.`,
  
  governanceToken: `TORUS tokens used for voting on proposals and participating in decentralized 
    governance processes.`,
  
  // ================= Compound Terms =================
  // Agent & Swarm together
  agentSwarm: `A coordinated group of autonomous entities working together in Torus toward 
    a common goal, forming organically around specific objectives and operating at multiple scales.`,

  // Protocol & Architecture Terms
  stakeBasedP2PProtocol: `A peer-to-peer network where participation and influence are determined by the amount of tokens locked (staked) in the system, ensuring aligned incentives among participants.`,

  fractalSuperSwarm: `A hierarchical structure where the entire system mirrors its own patterns at every scale. Smaller swarms within swarms, all following the same organizational principles.`,

  recursivelyDelegated: `A cascading permission system where agents can grant others the ability to further delegate their permissions, creating chains of trust and capability sharing.`,

  subgraph: `A smaller, self-contained network within the larger hypergraph that represents individual swarms and their internal relationships.`,

  stakeRoot: `The central origin point of the network's authority, derived from the collective stake of all token holders, serving as the ultimate source of permissions and incentives.`,

  // Coordination Terms
  topDownGoals: `Objectives set by root agents or high-level stakeholders that cascade through the network, providing direction while allowing bottom-up implementation.`,

  selfAssemblingMultiScaleCompetencyArchitecture: `Autonomous structures that spontaneously organize at different levels of complexity, with each level capable of solving problems appropriate to its scale.`,

  openCompetitionAtEveryEdge: `A system where any connection between agents can be challenged or improved by alternative solutions, ensuring continuous optimization.`,

  recursiveNicheConstruction: `The iterative process where swarms create specialized roles and environments that enable further specialization, building increasingly sophisticated capabilities.`,

  granularSpecialization: `The ability for agents to develop deep expertise in very specific areas while maintaining connections to the broader network through the permission system.`,

  emergentCentrality: `The spontaneous formation of functional centers of coordination through distributed alignment, without requiring fixed hierarchies or predefined control nodes. In Torus, centrality arises from recursive delegation and stake-weighted influence.`,


  // Implementation Terms
  pragmaticGrowthOriented: `Designed for real-world deployment with features that prioritize network expansion and adoption over theoretical completeness.`,

  battletesting: `Live deployment to stress-test concepts under real conditions with actual users and economic incentives.`,

  pureAndCompleteImplementation: `The final version that fully realizes all theoretical aspects of the Torus model without compromises made for initial deployment.`,


  // General Technical Terms
  recursive: `Recursive describes a process or definition that refers back to itself.
  It works by applying the same rule to a simpler version of the original.
  Each step breaks the problem into a smaller piece and repeats the same approach until it reaches that simplest instance.`
