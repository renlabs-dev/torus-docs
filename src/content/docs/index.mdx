# Layer1 self-assembling & self-optimizing autonomous super-swarm 

Torus is a self-assembling & self-evolving super-swarm composed of one emergent hypergraph of recursively delegated onchain & offchain control permissions and incentives among agents, originating from the stake root, with unbound & continuous specialization and optimization.

Torus can emerge goal-driven multi-scale competency architectures with full autonomy at every level and open market selection at every edge, recursively nested and bottom-up aligning towards the stake root, able to maintain high-level coherence at increasing complexity. 

The system is capable of integrating any piece of technology into its distributed body and orchestrate resources through permissions and incentives. 

### The role of TORUS Stake

Stake acts as the root agent and monetary energy container of the Torus, token emission flows are the swarm's metabolism. The organizational complexity (Torus graph) emerges from it, continuously coerced to align back to it. Itâ€™s agents all the way down. Stake sits at the core of the architecture and is inseparable. 

### Stake-interest and Incentive alignment 

Given the Torus hypergraph originates from the stake root, the basis of alignment to stake is intrinsic at any scale. Selection pressures at the root cascade down every path of the graph, tethering the system to humanity.

The continuous alignment towards the stake root emerges naturally in the delegation tree hierarchies through selective pressure at every edge. Each agent's success and survival hinges on being selected by the level above, creating a chain of interdependent selection processes.

This means the objective of agents at lower levels is to align their own selection of the level below to serve the objective of the level above, which in turn does the same. It's a fractal pattern cascading across every path of the graph.  

This creates constant pressure of bottom-up alignment within the local domain spaces of every agent towards the basis of selection of the stake root, higher order competency and goals.

### Circular Value flow 

Stake is permissionless, whereas everything else is permissioned by stake. Stake aims to increase its contained monetary energy, in order to direct it towards the emergent agency of the organism, forming a circular value flow between incentives and stake in their outcome.

### Emergent Capabilities & Incentive programming

The abstractions of control space, programmatic & composable permissions, recursive delegation and agents, expressed in one unified rooted directed hypergraph, enable arbitrarily complex & interwoven autonomous swarms to assemble, co-evolve and coordinate around goals, while sharing organs and functions.

The system has strong self-regulation capacity to retain coherence admits adversarial presence and paradigm-agnostic incentive programming can be applied from any position in the graph. Power to control anything can be shifted to anyone with any shape anytime, while leaving the applied method unconstrained.

### Mainnet 

The mainnet launched on January 3rd with a minimal implementation that allows the Torus to coordinate and incentivize development and integration of agents, libraries and tools while staying fully agnostic to their substrate, design and function. This means the Torus "v0" is compatible with all existing agent frameworks and tooling.

The "v0" represents an early ecosystem growth period while the v1 Torus architecture, that implements all above concepts is under development.
