title: General Subnet Module Curation DAO
description: Learn about the General DAO Subnet on the Torus Network and how it functions.

import { Aside, Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

The general subnet **(S2)** operates without a limiting consensus mechanism, allowing flexible weight allocation but requiring protection against abuse. The Module Curation DAO serves this purpose by maintaining an on-chain whitelist of validated module key addresses through a 2/3 majority voting system.

## Purpose and Function

The DAO protects against dishonest weights on junk modules by:

- Evaluating module applications based on clear value propositions
- Maintaining a curated whitelist of approved modules
- Enabling removal of modules that no longer meet standards
- Ensuring only quality modules receive stake-weight allocations

<Aside>
  Since the whitelist stores SS58 Addresses, modules don't need to reapply after
  deregistration.
</Aside>

## Module Requirements and Economics

### Whitelist Conditions

- Only whitelisted modules can receive stake-weight allocations
- Whitelisting is required for reward eligibility
- Modules must demonstrate clear value to the Torus ecosystem

### Economic Model

- Modules define stake-weight requirements for access
- Access bandwidth scales with allocated stake
- Rewards increase with stakeholder demand
- Flexible pricing models based on stake-weight

## Application and Registration Process

Modules can join through two pathways in the [Governance Portal][governance]:

<Steps>

1. S2 Application

   - `Propose Change → Create new S2 Application`
   - Full DAO review and voting process

2. Direct Registration
   - `Propose Change → Register a Module → S2`
   - Must meet pre-established criteria

</Steps>

## Governance Structure

### Decision Making

- 2/3 majority required for all decisions
- Members can initiate removal votes
- Applications undergo collective review and discussion

### Platform Integration

- Primary interface: [Governance Portal][governance]
- Validator interface: [Community Validator Platform][validator]
- Integrated weight management and stakeholder participation tracking

## Future Developments

The system will expand to include:

- API for modules to check stake-weight allocations
- Module idea suggestion platform
- Integration with new human-centric subnets
- Enhanced delegation capabilities for existing validators
