Torus is an open-ended experiment designed to bootstrap a self-assembling and evolving peer-to-peer organism. Over time, this organism forms its "organs" seamlessly integrating any piece of technology into its collective body.

The system operates as an emergent multi-graph, characterized by recursively delegated permissions and incentives among agents. These interactions span both on-chain protocols and off-chain agent-controlled spaces, anchored to the root agent stake. This structure forms a multi-scale competency architecture, capable of arbitrarily granular and complex specialization, aligning dynamically with the stake root.

Every part of the Torus has local autonomy and except the root agent (fully onchain) is unconstrained in its substrate, design and function.

### Stake in Torus

Stake is the root agent and monetary energy container of the Torus, emission flows are the organisms metabolism. The organizational complexity (Torus graph) emerges from it, coerced to continuously align back to it. Itâ€™s agents all the way down.

Continuous alignment towards the stake root emerges naturally in the delegation tree hierarchies through selective pressure at every edge. Each agent's success and survival depends on being selected by the level above, creating a chain of interdependent selection processes.

Meaning the objective of lower levels is to align their own selection of the level below to serve the objective of the level above, which in turn does the same. It's a fractal pattern cascading across every path of the graph.

This creates constant pressure of bottom-up alignment of adaptive trajectories within the local domain spaces/context of every agent towards the basis of selection of the stake root, higher order organism competency and goals.

Stake is permissionless, while everything else is permissioned by stake. Stake aims to increase its contained monetary energy, in order to direct it towards the emergent agency of the organism, forming a circular value flow between incentives and stake in their outcome.

The abstractions of control space, permissions, recursive programmatic delegation and agents, expressed in an emergent multi-graph, enable rich incentive programming with enough self-regulation capacity to maintain system coherence admits adversarial presence.

### v0 mainnet

The v0 mainnet launched on january 3rd is a minimal implementation that allows the Torus to coordinate and incentivize development and integration of agents, libraries and tools while staying fully agnostic to their substrate, design and function. This means the Torus v0 is compatible with all existing agent frameworks and tooling.

The v0 represents a early ecosystem growth period while the v1 Torus architecture is under development.
