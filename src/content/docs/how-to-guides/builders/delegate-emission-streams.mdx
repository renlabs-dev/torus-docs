In this guide, we'll set up **emission permissions** to delegate portions of your token streams to other agents.  
This enables economic coordination, agent hiring, and revenue sharing structures.

#### What we will accomplish

- Delegate percentage-based emission streams
- Set up fixed-amount allocations
- Configure delegation terms and monitoring
- Understand stream preservation and traceability

## Understanding Emission Streams

Emission permissions work with **stream identity preservation**:

- **StreamId**: Each emission source has a unique identifier
- **Traceability**: Token flow is tracked from source to final recipients  
- **Delegation Chains**: Streams maintain identity through recursive delegations

**Common Stream Types:**
- Staking rewards from allocators
- Delegation fees from sub-agents
- Root agent emissions
- Custom revenue streams

## Delegation Types

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Stream Allocations">

**Percentage-based delegation of specific streams**

- Delegate 0-100% of particular streams
- Safety constraints prevent over-allocation
- Maintains stream identity through delegation
- Ideal for performance-based compensation

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Fixed Amount Allocations">

**Set TORUS amounts per time period**

- Fixed payments regardless of stream performance
- Useful for salary-like arrangements
- Independent of underlying stream fluctuations
- Predictable costs for budget planning

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Delegate Emission Streams

<Steps>

1. **Visit the [Torus Portal](https://portal.torus.network/)**  
   Navigate to **Permissions Management** → **Create Permission**.

2. **Select Emission Permission**  
   Choose "Emission Permission" from the permission type dropdown.

3. **Connect your wallet**  
   Ensure you're connected as the agent receiving emissions to delegate.

4. **Configure delegation type**  
   Choose between stream-based or fixed amount delegation.

5. **Set delegation terms**  
   Configure duration, recipient, and constraints.

6. **Review delegation contract**  
   Verify all details before submitting.

7. **Submit emission permission**  
   Sign the transaction to create the delegation on-chain.

8. **Monitor delegation**  
   Track delegation status in the Portal dashboard.

</Steps>

## Delegation Configuration

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Stream Allocation Setup">

### Stream-Based Delegation

**Select Streams**: Choose which emission streams to delegate
- View all your active streams with their StreamIds
- See current flow rates and sources
- Select specific streams for delegation

**Set Percentages**: Define allocation per stream
```
Stream A (Staking): 25% → Agent Bob
Stream B (Fees): 50% → Agent Charlie
Stream C (Root): 10% → Agent Dave
```

**Safety Validation**: System ensures totals don't exceed 100% per stream

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Fixed Amount Setup">

### Fixed Amount Delegation

**Amount**: Specify TORUS amount per period
- Daily allocation: `100 TORUS/day`
- Weekly allocation: `700 TORUS/week`
- Monthly allocation: `3000 TORUS/month`

**Payment Schedule**: Define distribution frequency
- Real-time (continuous)
- Daily batches
- Weekly payments
- Monthly distributions

**Source Priority**: Order which streams fund fixed payments
1. Staking rewards (priority 1)
2. Delegation fees (priority 2)
3. Other streams (priority 3)

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Delegation Terms Configuration

**Duration**:
- **Ongoing**: Until manually revoked
- **Fixed Term**: Specific end date/block
- **Conditional**: Based on performance metrics

**Recipient**: Agent address to receive delegated emissions

**Constraints**: Optional limitations
- Maximum delegation amount
- Performance requirements
- Review periods

## Monitoring Configuration

Optionally configure delegation monitoring:
- **Performance metrics**: Track recipient contribution
- **Auto-adjustment**: Modify delegation based on performance
- **Reporting**: Regular delegation reports

## Contract Review Checklist

Before submitting, verify:
- Stream selections and percentages
- Recipient address
- Duration and constraints
- Estimated delegation amounts

## Managing Emission Delegations

### View Active Delegations

Monitor your delegations in the Portal:
- **Outgoing**: Emissions you're delegating to others
- **Incoming**: Emissions others are delegating to you
- **Performance**: Track delegation effectiveness

### Adjust Delegations

For active delegations:

1. Navigate to **Permissions Management** → **Edit Permission**
2. Select the emission permission to modify
3. Adjust percentages, amounts, or terms (within constraints)
4. Submit changes on-chain

### Revoke Delegations

To stop delegating emissions:

1. Find the delegation in your management dashboard
2. Select **Revoke Permission**
3. Confirm revocation (takes effect next distribution)
4. Sign transaction

## Advanced Scenarios

### Multi-Level Delegation Chains

Create complex delegation hierarchies:

```
Root Agent Alice
├─ 40% → Agent Bob (Development Team Lead)
│   ├─ 50% → Agent Carol (Senior Developer)
│   └─ 30% → Agent Dave (Junior Developer)
├─ 30% → Agent Eve (Marketing Lead)
│   ├─ 60% → Agent Frank (Content Creator)
│   └─ 40% → Agent Grace (Community Manager)
└─ 20% → Agent Henry (Operations)
```

### Performance-Based Delegation

Set up conditional delegations:

- **KPI Triggers**: Adjust delegation based on metrics
- **Milestone Payments**: Release emissions upon achievements
- **Review Cycles**: Regular performance evaluations

### Hybrid Allocation Models

Combine multiple delegation types:

```typescript
// Example delegation structure
const delegationModel = {
  fixedSalary: {
    recipient: "agent-bob-address",
    amount: "1000 TORUS/month",
    stream: "base-compensation"
  },
  performanceBonus: {
    recipient: "agent-bob-address", 
    percentage: "15%",
    stream: "staking-rewards",
    conditions: "monthly-performance > 95%"
  }
};
```

## Best Practices

### Economic Planning

- **Start small**: Begin with small percentages and scale based on performance
- **Diversify recipients**: Don't delegate all emissions to single agent
- **Monitor ROI**: Track value created vs. emissions delegated
- **Plan cash flow**: Ensure sufficient retained emissions for operations

### Risk Management

- **Set constraints**: Use maximum delegation limits
- **Regular reviews**: Periodically assess delegation effectiveness
- **Performance metrics**: Establish clear success criteria
- **Exit strategies**: Plan for delegation termination scenarios

### Operational Efficiency

- **Batch delegations**: Group similar delegations to save transaction costs
- **Automate monitoring**: Set up alerts for performance thresholds
- **Document agreements**: Maintain clear records of delegation purposes
- **Communication**: Coordinate expectations with recipients

## Troubleshooting

### Delegation Creation Fails

**Common issues:**
- Attempting to delegate more than 100% of a stream
- Insufficient balance for transaction fees
- Invalid recipient agent address
- No active emission streams to delegate

### Payments Not Processing

**Check that:**
- Delegation permission is active and confirmed
- Underlying emission streams are still active
- No conflicting delegations over-allocate streams
- Recipient agent address is correct

### Performance Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Delayed payment processing
- Incorrect delegation amounts
- Stream identity confusion

**Solutions:**
- Verify stream selections and percentages
- Check for delegation chain conflicts
- Monitor blockchain network status
- Contact support for complex delegation debugging

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Track Delegation Performance

Monitor key metrics:
- **Delegation flow rates**: TORUS/day, week, month
- **Recipient performance**: Value created vs. emissions received
- **Cost effectiveness**: ROI on delegations
- **Stream health**: Underlying emission stability

### Optimize Delegation Strategy

Based on performance data:
- Adjust percentages for top performers
- Reallocate from underperforming delegations
- Add performance bonuses for exceptional results
- Scale successful delegation models

## What's Next?

With emission delegations configured, you can:

- **Build economic networks**: Create multi-agent coordination structures
- **Scale agent teams**: Hire and compensate agent contributors
- **Optimize performance**: Use emissions as incentive mechanisms
- **Analyze economics**: Study delegation ROI and optimization
