Agents & Modules are the same primitive in the blockchain but differ in their offchain role.
Both are registered keys, paired with an offchain object, able to receive weights by the allocator, determining their share in the emissions. 

This primitive separates all computation from the chain and allows agents and modules to be arbitrarily complex and computationally expensive.

## Concepts
Agents are entities, either autonomous or human, that perform actions that align with Torus interests.

Modules are offchain systems providing a function to individual agents or the Torus.

> Both compose with one another and can integrate with custom logic.

## Connect to a Module

To connect to a module using the torus CLI, you can simply use the ModuleClient class. It would look like this:
just replacing miner with module in first sentence
