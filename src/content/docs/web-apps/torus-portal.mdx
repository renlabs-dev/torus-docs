  - Create permission
  - Edit permission
- Capability operations
  - Register capability
  - Delete capability
- Network operations
  - Register agent
  - Create signal

to create a permission, you need to click on the "Create permission" button, which will take you to the "Create permission" form.

there you can choose on the top right of the form the type of permission you want to create, either capability or emission, and then you can fill in the form with the required fields.

to edit a permission, you need to click on the "Edit permission" button, which will take you to the "Edit permission" form, there you can also "revoke" the permission (if revocable).

## Creating a capability

to create a capability, you need to click on the "Register capability" button, which will take you to the "Register capability" form, there you choose the path of your namespace, as well as the REST method you want to create the capability for.
