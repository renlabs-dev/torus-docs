## With the torus-cli

You can use the [torus-cli.module.client.ModuleClient](https://docs.torus.network/todo) to request miners.
You can then score their answers according to the validation mechanism of the subnet
and use [torus-cli.client.vote](https://docs.torus.network/todo) to cast a vote and set weights into it.

Note that each subnet specifies a set of
parameters that can change what is considered a valid vote or not. If you need to consult the parameters of the specific
subnet in which you want to run your validator, you can use the command:

```sh
comx subnet info <netuid>
```

## On your own

If you want to implement your own client, the specifications are described on [Module Connect](/modules/connect-to-a-module).
