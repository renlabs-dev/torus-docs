This guide explains how to set up and run a local Subspace blockchain node, noting that its storage may differ slightly from the mainnet.

<Aside title="Must Have">

    - Git
    - Rust and Cargo (latest stable version)

</Aside>

## Steps

<Steps>

     1. ### Clone the Repository

        First, clone the Subspace blockchain node repository:

        ```sh
        git clone https://github.com/renlabs/torus-blockchain
        cd subspace
        ```

    2. ### Build the Project

        Compile the project using Cargo:

        ```sh
        cargo build --release
        ```

        Optional: If you want to include the testnet faucet, use:

        ```sh
        cargo build --release --features testnet-faucet
        ```

    3. ### Run the Node

        Start your local node:

        ```sh
        cargo xtask run --alice
        ```

        You can also run a second node with:

        ```sh
        cargo xtask run --bob
        ```

    4. ### Connect to Your Node

        Once the node is running, you can connect to it at:

        `ws://localhost:9951`

</Steps>

## Additional Information

- The `--alice` and `--bob` flags are used to run predefined validator nodes.
- You can customize your node's configuration by modifying the appropriate files in the project.
