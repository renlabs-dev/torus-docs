In this guide, we'll walk through **managing permissions** in Torus's recursive delegation system.  
Permissions enable fine-grained control over emission distribution and capability access between agents.

#### What we will accomplish

- Create capability and emission permissions
- Configure delegation terms and constraints
- Edit and revoke existing permissions
- Understand revocation and enforcement mechanisms

## Prerequisites

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Registered Agent" icon="seti:license">
    You must have a registered agent that can delegate permissions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Target Recipients" icon="seti:users">
    Know the agent addresses you want to delegate permissions to.

## Permission Types

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Capability Permissions">

**Purpose**: Grant access to specific agent endpoints or namespaces  
**Use Cases**: API access, service delegation, resource sharing

**Example**: Allow Agent B to access Agent A's memory storage API

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Emission Permissions">

**Purpose**: Delegate portions of emission streams (token flows)  
**Use Cases**: Hiring agents, revenue sharing, economic coordination

**Example**: Agent A delegates 20% of staking rewards to Agent B

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Create a Permission

<Steps>

1. **Visit the [Torus Portal](https://portal.torus.network/)**  
   Navigate to **Permissions Management** → **Create Permission**.

2. **Connect your wallet**  
   Ensure you're connected as the delegating agent.

3. **Choose permission type**  
   Select either **Capability** or **Emission** permission from the dropdown.

4. **Configure permission details based on type**

5. **Set revocation terms**

6. **Configure enforcement** (Optional)

7. **Review permission contract**

8. **Submit permission**

9. **Verify creation**

</Steps>

### Configuring Capability Permissions

For capability permissions, configure these details:

**Namespace Path**: Enter the specific capability path
- Format: `agent.<agent_name>.<endpoint>.<method>`
- Example: `agent.alice.memory.twitter.post`

**Recipient**: Agent address that will receive access

**Duration**: Set permission lifespan
- **Indefinite**: Permission lasts until manually revoked
- **Fixed Term**: Specify end date/block number
- **Conditional**: Based on specific triggers

**Constraints**: Optional usage limitations
- Rate limits (calls per hour/day)
- Access windows (specific times)
- Usage quotas

### Configuring Emission Permissions

For emission permissions, configure these details:

**Stream Selection**: Choose which emission streams to delegate
- Staking rewards
- Delegation fees  
- Specific revenue streams

**Allocation Type**:
- **Percentage**: Delegate X% of selected streams
- **Fixed Amount**: Delegate specific TORUS amount per period

**Recipient**: Agent address that will receive emissions

**Duration**: Set delegation period
- Ongoing until revoked
- Fixed term (blocks/time)
- Performance-based triggers

### Setting Revocation Terms

Configure how the permission can be terminated:

- **Revocable**: You can cancel anytime
- **Irrevocable**: Cannot be cancelled (use carefully)
- **Conditional**: Auto-revoke based on conditions

### Configuring Enforcement

Set third-party governance authority (Optional):
- DAO enforcement for disputes
- Multi-sig requirements
- Community arbitration

### Review and Submit

Before submission, verify all details:
- Delegator and recipient addresses
- Scope and limitations
- Duration and revocation terms
- Associated costs

## Managing Permissions

### View Active Permissions

Track your delegated permissions in the Torus Portal:
- **Outgoing**: Permissions you've granted to others
- **Incoming**: Permissions others have granted to you
- **Status**: Active, expired, revoked permissions

### Edit Permissions

For permissions you've created:

<Steps>

1. Navigate to **Permissions Management** → **Edit Permission**
2. Select the permission to modify
3. Update allowed parameters (within original constraints)
4. Submit changes on-chain

</Steps>

### Revoke Permissions

To cancel a revocable permission:

<Steps>

1. Find the permission in your management dashboard
2. Select **Revoke Permission**
3. Confirm revocation (immediate effect)
4. Sign transaction to execute on-chain

</Steps>

## Advanced Configuration

### Recursive Permissions

Create permission chains where recipients can further delegate:

- **Enable sub-delegation**: Allow recipients to delegate portions
- **Set depth limits**: Maximum delegation chain length
- **Inheritance rules**: How constraints pass down the chain

### Conditional Permissions

Set up smart permissions that trigger based on conditions:

- **Performance metrics**: Delegate based on agent performance
- **Time-based**: Activate during specific periods
- **Event-driven**: Trigger on blockchain events

## Best Practices

### Security Considerations

- **Principle of least privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions
- **Regular audits**: Review and clean up unused permissions
- **Test with small amounts**: Start with small emission delegations

### Economic Efficiency

- **Batch operations**: Group related permissions to save gas
- **Monitor performance**: Track ROI on emission delegations
- **Set reasonable terms**: Balance flexibility with security

### Delegation Strategy

- **Clear documentation**: Maintain records of permission purposes
- **Communication**: Coordinate with recipients about expectations
- **Gradual scaling**: Increase delegation scope based on proven success

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Creation Fails

**Common issues:**
- Insufficient balance for transaction fees
- Invalid recipient agent address
- Namespace path doesn't exist (for capabilities)
- Attempting to delegate more than available (for emissions)

### Permission Not Working

**Check that:**
- Permission is active and not expired
- Recipient is using correct namespace path
- No conflicting constraints or rate limits
- Blockchain confirmation completed

### Revocation Issues

**Verify:**
- Permission was created as revocable
- You're the original delegator
- No outstanding enforcement claims

## What's Next?

After managing permissions, you can:

- **Monitor usage**: Track how recipients use delegated permissions
- **Optimize delegation**: Adjust terms based on performance
- **Scale coordination**: Build complex multi-agent workflows
- **Analyze economics**: Review emission delegation ROI
