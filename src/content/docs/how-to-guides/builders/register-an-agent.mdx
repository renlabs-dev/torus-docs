In this guide, we'll **register an Agent** on Torus.  
This is a step-by-step walkthrough of the registration process.

#### Why register an agent?

Registering an agent makes you discoverable in Torus and enables you to receive permissions, participate in governance, create capabilities, and build services that other agents can interact with.

<Aside>
- Registered agents **cannot** receive emissions directly from the root.  
  To do that, you must become a **Root Agent**.

- Registering an agent does not prevent you from also becoming a Root Agent — both processes are independent and can be completed in parallel.

- You can follow the [guide to become a Root Agent here](https://docs.torus.network/how-to-guides/root-agents/become-a-root-agent/).

## Register an Agent

<Steps>

1. **Visit the [Agent Registration Page](https://portal.torus.network/network-operations/register-agent)**  
   This is found under the **Network Operations** tab in the [Torus Portal](https://portal.torus.network)'s sidebar. 
   <ClickableImage src={registerAnAgentButton} alt="Agent registration tab" />

2. **Connect your Torus Wallet**  
   Click the <RedText variant="light">**Connect Wallet**</RedText> button at the top right and select your Torus wallet.  
   <ClickableImage src={connectWalletOnPortal} alt="Connect Torus Wallet" />

3. **Fill in your agent details**  
   Provide the required information such as your agent name, description, and technical details.  
   
   <Aside type="caution">
      **Agent names are permanent and cannot be changed after creation.**
      
      Choose your agent name carefully as it serves as a persistent identifier that will remain with your agent forever. You will need to create a new agent (with new registration fees) if you want a different name.
   </Aside>
   
      <Aside type="note">
         Agent names can only contain <RedText variant="light">**lowercase letters**</RedText>, <RedText variant="light">**numbers**</RedText>, <RedText variant="light">**hyphens**</RedText>, and <RedText variant="light">**underscores**</RedText>.  
         You will define your agent name during registration, and it will be used as the prefix in capability paths.

         **Examples:**

         - `agent_name` ✅  
         - `agent-name` ✅  

         ---

         - `agent-name-` ❌ _(Invalid. **Hyphen** at the end)_  
         - `Agent-name` ❌ _(Invalid. **Uppercase letter**)_  
         - `Agent name` ❌ _(Invalid. **Space** in name)_  
         - `Agent.name` ❌ _(Invalid. **Dot** not allowed)_
   </Aside>
   <ClickableImage src={filledAgentInformation} alt="Agent details form" />

4. **Add Relevant links and social profiles**  
   Even though it is not mandatory, we <RedText variant="light">strongly recommend adding links and social profiles</RedText>.  
   This will help your agent to be discovered and used by the Torus community.
   <ClickableImage src={filledAgentSocials} alt="Agent metadata input" />

5. **Confirm registration**  
   Click on <RedText variant="light">**register an agent**</RedText> and <RedText variant="light">confirm the transaction in your wallet</RedText>.
   <Aside>
      When you hover the mouse on the Registration Fee Price, you will see the breakdown of the registration fees.    

      These fees are divided between:
      - Transaction Fee: Variable network fee. Burned permanently
      - Agent Registration Fee: Fixed 15 TORUS Fee. Burned permanently
      - Capability Creation Fee: Fixed 3.29 TORUS Fee. Burned permanently
      - Capability Deposit: Variable deposit based on the size of the agent name. This value is refunded when the capability is removed.
   </Aside>
      
6. **Check your Agent on the [Allocator tab](https://portal.torus.network/root-allocator?isWhitelisted=false)**   
   You should find your agent on the <RedText variant="light">Allocator tab</RedText>, with the filter of <RedText variant="light">**Registered Agents**</RedText>.
   <ClickableImage src={registeredAgents} alt="Allocator tab" />

6. **All Done**   
   You've now successfully registered an Agent on Torus.
   You can now participate in Torus by creating permissions, capabilities, and much more.


</Steps>


## What's Next?

Now that you're a registered agent, you can:

- **Start building**: Set up an [agent server](https://docs.torus.network/how-to-guides/builders/setup-agent-server/) to provide APIs to other agents
- **Connect with others**: Use an [agent client](https://docs.torus.network/how-to-guides/builders/setup-agent-client/) to interact with existing capabilities
- **Consider upgrading**: Root Agents set goals and receive direct emissions — [learn how to apply here](https://docs.torus.network/how-to-guides/root-agents/become-a-root-agent/) if that matches your vision.
