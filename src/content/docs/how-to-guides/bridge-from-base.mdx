In this guide, we'll **bridge TORUS between Torus and Base**.  
This process is necessary in order to obtain **Native TORUS**, which is required to interact with Torus directly.

#### Why bridge TORUS tokens?

You need Native TORUS to participate in Torus - it's required for registering agents, becoming a Root Agent, staking, governance voting, and all on-chain activities. Bridging converts your Base TORUS into the native format.

To keep things clear and concise, **Native TORUS** will be referred to as **TORUS** from this point forward.

#### What we will accomplish

- Bridge TORUS on Base to TORUS EVM
- Bridge from TORUS EVM to TORUS

## Prerequisites

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Torus Wallet" icon="seti:license">
    A Torus wallet connected.  
    If you don't have one, you can follow the [setup guide here](https://docs.torus.network/how-to-guides/setup-a-wallet/).
  </Card>

  <Card title="Base TORUS Wallet" icon="seti:config">
    For this guide, we will be using [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) as our wallet of choice.  
    You must have enough funds to cover the bridge fees.  
    {/* If you don't have Base TORUS or funds to cover the fees, you can follow the steps in this video tutorial by Omni Labs. */}

  Avoid storing BASE TORUS in SubWallet, as it will cause issues with the bridge that could result in loss of funds.

## Steps for the Bridge Process

### Bridge BASE Torus to Torus EVM

<Steps>

1. **Connect both the Torus and MetaMask wallets in the [Base Bridge Web App](https://bridge.torus.network/?tab=base&from=base&to=torus)**.   
   At the top right corner of the app, connect both your **Torus Wallet** and **MetaMask**.
   <ClickableImage src={metamaskSubwalletConnect} alt="SubWallet and MetaMask connect screen" />

2. **Swap from Base TORUS to Torus EVM**  
    - Make sure you are **connected** to **both wallets**
    - Make sure you are on the **correct tab**, **TORUS EVM - Base**
    - Make sure it is **FROM** Base TORUS **TO** Torus EVM
   
   Fill in the form with the amount you want to convert and the Recipient Address, by clicking on the Self button, it will automatically fill the address for you with your connected base wallet.
   With all the information filled in, click **Continue**.

3. **Confirm the transaction**   
   After filling in the form, you will be prompted to confirm the transaction in Metamask.
   <Aside type="caution">
      Always verify the transaction in MetaMask before signing it, as it is your responsibility to verify the transaction details.  
      You also must have enough funds in your MetaMask wallet to cover the transaction fees.
   </Aside>

4. **Confirmation of the swap**  
   After the transaction succeeds, your Base TORUS should now be displayed as Torus EVM as it was successfully swapped.  
   This process can take a while to complete on the blockchain,
   so please wait a few minutes and refresh the [Base Bridge Web App](https://bridge.torus.network/?tab=base&from=base&to=torus).   
   If you have any issues, reach out to our support on the [Official Torus Discord](https://discord.gg/torus).
