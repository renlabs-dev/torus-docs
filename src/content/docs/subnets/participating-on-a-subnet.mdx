# Participating on a subnet

[Learn what a subnet is](/subnets/what-is-a-subnet)

Subnets have 3 classes of actors:

- Subnet [Founder](/subnets/building-a-subnet)
- Subnet [Validators](/validating/what-is-validating)
- Subnet [Miners](/cs/mining/what-is-mining)

If you are a holder and want to access or support a subnet with your stake, start a validator or delegate your stake to a validator who is setting his rootnet weights on that subnet.

If you want to mine on a subnet, look into their github repository and resources provided by the subnet team to get an idea of what is required.

If you want to build a subnet, read [this](/subnets/building-a-subnet) and familiarize yourself with [Yuma Consensus](/subspace/yuma-consensus).
