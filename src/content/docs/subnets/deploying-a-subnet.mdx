## Registering a New Subnet

After you have your full subnet code ready, according to all of the predefined requirements.
Proceed with registering a new subnet storage.

You can register a new subnet by proceeding with the following command:

```bash
tor subnet register <key-name> <subnet-name>  [--metadata]
```

<Aside type="caution">
  You will be asked to pay a subnet burn fee, these tokens will be permanently
  lost. To determine the cost beforehand, you can query:

```bash
tor subnet params
```

and look for the `_subnet_registration_cost_` field.

</Aside>

After you registered your subnet, you are still not eligible for an emission distribution.
For **emissions** to start your subnet there will need to be enough consensus weight set on it by rootnet validators.
