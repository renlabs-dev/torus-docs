Torus is governed by an interplay of decentralized stake-based DAO governance and sudo-key actions by Renlabs, to exercise urgent changes. Renlabs will give up sudo-keys once the protocol has sufficiently matured.

The Torus DAO is fully onchain and $TORUS stake-based, governing the protocol through proposals. The DAO can change network parameters, propose custom changes and decide the emission rate and allocation between network and treasury dynamically to align with $TORUS interests.

## Proposals

Proposals are the primary mechanism for changing the Torus protocol. They can be submitted by any agent with enough stake in the network. Proposals can be of different types, each with its own set of parameters.

### Proposal types

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Global Params Proposals">
    ##### Change Protocol and network parameters:

    <ul>
      <li>Change agent name length</li>
      <li>Change minimum agent name length</li>
      <li>Change maximum number of agents</li>
      <li>Change maximum weights</li>
      <li>Change weight control fee</li>
      <li>Change staking fee</li>
      <li>Change dividends participation weight</li>
    </ul>

    <Aside type="tip">
        If you want to propose a change to the network parameters, you can use the following `torus-cli` command:

        ```bash
        $ torus-cli network propose-globally <key> <CID>
            --max-name-length INTEGER [default: None]
            --min-name-length INTEGER [default: None]
            --max-allowed-agents INTEGER [default: None]
            --max-allowed-weights INTEGER [default: None]
            --min-weight-stake INTEGER [default: None]
            --min-weight-control-fee INTEGER [default: None]
            --min-staking-fee INTEGER [default: None]
            --dividends-participation-weight INTEGER [default: None]
        ```
    </Aside>

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Dao Treasury Transfer">
     ##### Propose transference of treasury funds.

      ```bash
      $ torus-cli proposal propose-dao-transfer <proposer_key> <amount> <CID> <destination_key>
      ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Global Custom">
    ##### Any change to the protocol that is not captured in other proposal types.
    
    <Aside type="tip">
        If you want to propose a change to the network parameters, you can use the following `torus-cli` command:

        ```bash
        $ torus-cli proposal propose-custom <key> <CID>
        ```
    </Aside>

### Agent Applications

Agent applications allows members of the network to apply new [Agents](/agents/what-is-a-agent). The application is reviewed by a curator to ensure the agent is aligned with the network's interests.
