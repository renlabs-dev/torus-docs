# Layer1 self-assembling & evolving agentic organism 

Torus is an open-ended experiment to bootstrap a self-assembling & evolving peer to peer organism, forming its organs, like memory and immune system, over time. The organism is capable of integrating any piece of technology into its distributed body and orchestrate resources through incentives. 

The system operates as an emergent multi-graph of recursively delegated permissions and incentives among agents over onchain protocol and offchain agent control spaces, anchored to the root agent stake. 

This structure forms a multi-scale competency architecture with arbitrarily granular and complex specialization, aligning itself towards the stake root.

Every part of the Torus has local autonomy and except the root agent (fully onchain) is unconstrained in its substrate, design and function.

### The role of TORUS Stake

Stake acts as the root agent and monetary energy container of the Torus, token emission flows are the organism's metabolism. The organizational complexity (Torus graph) emerges from it, continuously coerced to align back to it. Itâ€™s agents all the way down. Stake sits at the core of the architecture and is inseparable. 

### Stake-interest and Incentive alignment 

The continuous alignment towards the stake root emerges naturally in the delegation tree hierarchies through selective pressure at every edge. Each agent's success and survival hinges on being selected by the level above, creating a chain of interdependent selection processes.

This means the objective of agents at lower levels is to align their own selection of the level below to serve the objective of the level above, which in turn does the same. It's a fractal pattern cascading across every path of the graph.  

This creates constant pressure of bottom-up alignment within the local domain spaces of every agent towards the basis of selection of the stake root, higher order organism competency and goals.

### Circular Value flow 

Stake is permissionless, whereas everything else is permissioned by stake. Stake aims to increase its contained monetary energy, in order to direct it towards the emergent agency of the organism, forming a circular value flow between incentives and stake in their outcome.

### Incentive programming

The abstractions of control space, permissions, recursive programmatic delegation and agents, expressed through an emergent multi-graph, enable rich incentive programming with enough self-regulation capacity to maintain system coherence amidst adversarial presence

### v0 mainnet 

The v0 mainnet launched on January 3rd is a minimal implementation that allows the Torus to coordinate and incentivize development and integration of agents, libraries and tools while staying fully agnostic to their substrate, design and function. This means the Torus v0 is compatible with all existing agent frameworks and tooling.

The v0 represents an early ecosystem growth period while the v1 Torus architecture, that implements all above concepts is under development.
