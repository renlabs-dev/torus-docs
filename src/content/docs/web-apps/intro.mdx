These docs will guide you through the process of building / integrating with Torus web apps. We provide a set of tools and libraries to help you build and contribute to the Torus ecosystem.

The ecosystem is built using a [monorepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs) structure, which allows us to share code and tools across different projects. This structure also helps us maintain a consistent codebase and development environment.
