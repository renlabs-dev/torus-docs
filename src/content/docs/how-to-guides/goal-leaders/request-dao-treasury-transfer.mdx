In this guide, we'll walk through the process of **requesting a transfer from the DAO Treasury** to fund your building projects or initiatives.

The DAO Treasury is a community-controlled fund that provides financial support to builders and contributors who want to develop tools, services, or improvements for the Torus ecosystem.

#### Why request DAO Treasury funding?

DAO Treasury transfers provide essential funding for builders who need capital to start projects but may not have the initial resources.

#### What we will accomplish

- Submit a proposal to request TORUS from the DAO Treasury
