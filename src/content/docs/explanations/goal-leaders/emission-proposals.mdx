Emission proposals can adapt the token emission rate and distribution across different coponents of the protocol.

These proposals allow the community to adapt the macro-economics of the network based on the network's context and external conditions. They can shift both the rate of emissions, and how those emissions are distributed between agents, allocator dividends and the protocol treasury. 

<Aside type="tip">
**Emission proposals require community consensus** through the governance voting process, ensuring that changes to network economics reflect the collective will of TORUS stakeholders.

## How Emission Proposals Work

Emission proposals allow TORUS stakeholders to configure 3 key percentage parameters:

### Core Parameters

The three parameters control two separate distribution pools:

**Burn Distribution (up to 100% total):**
- **Recycling Percentage**: Portion of emissions that is recycled 
- **Treasury Percentage**: Portion allocated to the protocol treasury

The remaining % of emissions is distributed to the network. 

*Note: Recycling Percentage + Treasury Percentage can be up to 100% total (e.g., 60% combined is valid)*

**Incentive Distribution (up to 100% total):**
- **Incentives Ratio**: The incentive distribution ratio between agents and stake allocator dividends

### Proposal conditions

For a proposal to pass, it must meet two requirements:
- **Majority Support**: More than 50% of votes must be positive
- **Participation Threshold**: Total votes must exceed 10% of all TORUS staked in the network + it must be at least 2 days old
