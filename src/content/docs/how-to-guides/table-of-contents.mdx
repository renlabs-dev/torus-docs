Welcome to the **How-to Guides** section of the Torus documentation.

These guides are focused, practical, and designed to help you achieve specific outcomes within the Torus ecosystem — without distractions or deep dives into theory.   
If you prefer to start with the theory first, begin with [Explanations](https://docs.torus.network/explanations/table-of-contents) and continue from there.   
Whether you're here to use Torus, build on it, or coordinate its evolution, there's a guide to get you there.
