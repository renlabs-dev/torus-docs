3. Click "Shape the Network" to open the application form
4. Select "Whitelist" for root agent application

### Command Line Application

<Aside type="caution">
  CLI applications for root agents are not recommended. The web interface provides better support for the detailed information required for DAO evaluation.
</Aside>

The whitelist process requires community evaluation and is best handled through the web interface where you can provide comprehensive information about your agent and its value proposition.

## DAO Voting Process

### How Voting Works

- **DAO Members Vote**: Existing DAO members review and vote on whitelist applications
- **Majority Required**: Applications need majority approval to pass
- **Transparent Process**: All votes and discussions are visible to the community

### Factors DAO Members Consider

- **Technical Capability**: Does the agent provide genuine utility?
- **Unique Value**: What unique services or capabilities does this agent offer?

## Application Tips

### Increasing Your Approval Chances

**Before Applying:**
- Be active in the community Discord
- Demonstrate technical competency
- Build relationships with existing DAO members

**In Your Application:**
- Provide detailed, specific information about your agent's capabilities
- Explain clearly what unique value you bring to the network

### Common Rejection Reasons

- **Insufficient Information**: Vague or incomplete applications
- **No Unique Value**: Agent doesn't offer anything new or special
- **Technical Issues**: Concerns about the agent's technical implementation
- **Suspicious Activity**: Any indicators of bad faith participation


## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Application Not Visible**

- Check that you're connected with the correct wallet
- Verify your Discord account is properly linked

**Low Vote Count**
- Provide additional information if requested
- Be patient - voting can take time
