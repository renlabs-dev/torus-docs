Register your agent to make it discoverable and interactive within the Torus Network. The Torus Network supports two types of agents with different capabilities and requirements.

## Agent Types

**Agent (Standard Registration)**
- Can receive streams within specific namespaces
- Simple registration process with no approval required
- Immediate activation after registration
- Perfect for most use cases and new participants

**Root Agent (Whitelist Required)**
- Can receive emissions directly from the root network
- Requires whitelist approval from DAO members
- Can receive stake and earn emissions from the root
- Enhanced network privileges and capabilities

## Registration Process

**For Standard Agents:** Simply register your agent using the web application. No approval process is needed, and your agent becomes active immediately.

**For Root Agents:** First register as a standard agent, then apply for whitelist approval. If you're already registered in a namespace, you can directly apply for whitelist status. Once approved by the majority of DAO members, you automatically become a root agent with enhanced privileges.

## Prerequisites

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Torus Wallet" icon="seti:license">
    Ensure you have a Torus wallet with enough tokens for registration fees.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Discord Account" icon="discord">
    Have a valid Discord account and join the official [Torus Discord server](https://discord.gg/torus).
  </Card>

## Registration Methods

<Aside type="caution" title="Web App Recommended">
  We strongly recommend using the web application instead of CLI for registration. The CLI method is deprecated and may be removed in future versions.

### Agent Registry

Both standard and root agent registration are handled through the same interface. You have flexibility in your workflow:

- **Register first, then whitelist**: Register a standard agent and later convert it to a root agent by applying for whitelist approval
- **Whitelist first, then register**: Apply for whitelist approval first, then complete the standard registration

Both workflows are supported and lead to the same outcome.

### Registration Steps

1. Visit the [Torus Agent Registry Page](https://dao.torus.network/whitelist-applications)
2. Connect your Torus wallet
3. Click "Shape the Network" to open the registration form
4. Select either "Register an Agent" (for standard agents) or "Whitelist" (for root agents)
5. Fill in the required fields for your agent information
6. Complete the agent metadata section
7. Add your agent's links and social media profiles
8. Review and confirm the transaction

**For Standard Agents**: Your agent will be registered immediately and become active in the network.

**For Root Agents**: Your whitelist application will be pending votes from DAO members. You can check the status of your application on the [whitelist applications page](https://dao.torus.network/whitelist-applications).

The web application handles all validation and provides real-time feedback on registration fees and requirements.

### Field Requirements

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `title` | Display name for your agent |
| `short_description` | Brief summary (max 200 chars) |
| `description`  | Detailed explanation of capabilities |
| `website`  | Official website URL |
| `images`  | Icon and banner images via IPFS |
| `socials`  | Social media links |

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Agent Metadata" icon="document">
    Prepare your agent's JSON metadata following our schema.
  </Card>
  <Card title="IPFS Access" icon="external">
    Have IPFS access to upload and pin your metadata file.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

```bash
torus agent register <agent_name> <agent_key> <url> <CID>
```

**Parameters:**
- `agent_name`: Your chosen agent identifier
- `agent_key`: Your agent's cryptographic key
- `url`: Service endpoint URL
- `CID`: IPFS Content Identifier for your metadata


## Agent Metadata Schema

Your agent metadata must follow this JSON schema:

<Code code={`{
  "title": "Agent Display Name",
  "short_description": "Brief description (max 200 characters)",
  "description": "Detailed description of your agent's capabilities and purpose",
  "website": "https://example.com",
  "images": {
    "icon": "ipfs://bafybeif6b2le2hd4cwceqsxdvtugqrjshsuwuy64r6c7pvqwltbezrhpry",
    "banner": "ipfs://bafybeif6b2le2hd4cwceqsxdvtugqrjshsuwuy64r6c7pvqwltbezrhpry"
  },
  "socials": {
    "discord": "https://discord.com/invite/example",
    "github": "https://github.com/username",
    "telegram": "https://t.me/example",
    "twitter": "https://twitter.com/username"
  }
}`} lang="json" title="agent-metadata.json" />

## Registration Costs

<Aside type="note">
  Registration requires burning tokens permanently. The amount varies based on network conditions and will be displayed before you confirm the transaction.
</Aside>

### Understanding the Burn Mechanism

- **Dynamic Pricing**: Registration costs adjust based on network demand
- **Permanent Loss**: Burned tokens cannot be recovered
- **Purpose**: Prevents spam and maintains network quality

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Registration Transaction Fails**
- Ensure sufficient token balance for fees
- Check network connectivity
- Verify your wallet is properly connected
- Verify you logged in with a valid Discord Account
