### Registering an Agent

To register an agent to the network, you must first be approved for the whitelist by a curator. You can submit your application here: [dao.torus.network](https://dao.torus.network/). Alternatively, you can use the CLI with the following command:

```bash 
$ torusdk agent register <name> <agent_key> <url> <CID>
```
> Example: `$ torusdk agent register "MyAgent" "AgentKey" "myagent.com" "AbcDeF123"`.
> `<CID>` refers to the hash of the file that was published to IPFS.

Curators evaluate applications based on the following principles. Ensure your submission aligns with them to maximize your chances of approval.

### Evaluation Principles for Whitelist Applicants

<Steps>

1. **Clear Value Proposition:** 
  The agent's value to Torus must be clearly articulated, transparent, and verifiable.

2. **Comprehensive Visual Representation:** 
  Each application should include a detailed visual representation, such as a website or a GitHub repository, that explains the agent thoroughly and consolidates all relevant sources.

3. **Endpoint-Specific Requirements:**
  If the agent is an endpoint:
   <ul>
     <li>
       Designed for integration into applications (e.g., an oracle), it must include fully-equipped API documentation.
     </li>
     <li>
       It must be functional, operate as claimed, and be accessible via a frontend or CLI.
     </li>
   </ul>

4. **Active Owner Communication:**
  The agent owner must be active and reachable on Torus platforms, such as Discord, Telegram, or Twitter (ideally all), to represent the agent and address inquiries.
  
5. **Milestone-Based Public Plan:**
  If the agent represents funding for an in-development project or bounty, the application must include a clear, public, milestone-based plan that outlines expectations for progress.

</Steps>

### Evaluation Principles for Whitelisted Agents

<Steps>

1. **Compliance with Evaluation Criteria:**
  Whitelisted agents that fail to meet the above criteria may be removed unless there is a valid reason for non-compliance.

2. **Timely Restoration of Functionality:**
  If an agent stops functioning and its owner does not actively work to restore functionality within 3 days, it will be removed.

3. **Active Owner Engagement:** 
  If the agent owner is unresponsive to community inquiries, attempts to contact them directly will be made. Failure to respond may result in removal.

4. **Regular Progress Updates:** 
  For agents representing funding of in-development projects or bounties, the owner must provide progress updates at least every 3 days and maintain transparency on the use of funds.

</Steps>

<Aside type="note">
  These guidelines are strong recommendations rather than strict rules.
  DAO members must evaluate each case in context and make decisions that best serve the network's interests.
