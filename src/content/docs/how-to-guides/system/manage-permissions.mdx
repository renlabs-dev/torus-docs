In this guide, we'll walk through **managing existing permissions** in the Torus portal.  
Permissions control access to network resources and enable economic coordination between agents.

## Permission Types

Torus has two distinct permission types that can be managed:

**Capability Permissions**: Control access to specific agent endpoints and APIs  
**Stream Permissions**: Enable economic coordination by delegating token emission streams

Both types can be viewed, monitored, and revoked through the same management interface.

#### What we will accomplish

- [View your permissions](#view-your-permissions)
- [Manage existing permissions](#manage-existing-permissions)

## Prerequisites

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Registered Agent" icon="seti:license">
    You must have a registered agent on Torus.
    Follow the [agent registration guide](https://docs.torus.network/how-to-guides/builders/register-an-agent/) if needed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Torus Balance" icon="seti:shell">
    Ensure you have enough TORUS to cover permission creation and transaction fees.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Existing Permissions" icon="seti:pipeline">
    You must have existing permissions (either as delegator or recipient) to manage them.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## View Your Permissions


Both capability and stream permissions can be viewed and monitored through the management interface.

<Steps>

1. **Visit the [Manage Permissions](https://torus.network/permissions/manage-permission) Tab in the Torus Portal**  
   It can be found in the left-hand navigation bar of the [Torus Portal](https://torus.network/portal).

2. **Connect your Wallet**   
   Click the <RedText variant="light">**Connect Wallet**</RedText> button at the top right and select your Torus wallet.

3. **Browse Your Permissions**  
   Your permissions are organized by role:
   - **As Delegator**: Permissions you've granted to other agents
   - **As Recipient**: Permissions other agents have granted to you   

4. **Review Permission Details**   
   Click on any permission from the list to open a detailed modal showing:
   
   ```md
   # For All Permissions
   Permission ID: Unique hash identifier
   Delegator: Agent name and wallet address who granted the permission
   Type: Either "Capability" or "Stream"

   Duration: Permission lifespan ("Indefinite", "Until Block X")
   Revocation: Terms for cancelling ("Revocable by Delegator", etc.)
   Created At: Block number when permission was created
   
   # Additional for Capability Permissions
   Recipient: Agent name and wallet address receiving the permission
   Capability Path: Specific endpoint being delegated

   # Additional for Stream Permissions

   Execution Count: Number of times the permission has been executed
   Stream Details: Information about delegated emission streams
   ```

</Steps>


## Manage Existing Permissions


Both capability and stream permissions can be managed through the same interface, but with different management options:

- **Capability Permissions**: Can be edited (modify terms) and revoked
- **Stream Permissions**: Can only be revoked (no editing available)

<Steps>

1. **Visit the [Manage Permissions](https://torus.network/permissions/manage-permission) Tab in the Torus Portal**  

   It can be found in the left-hand navigation bar of the [Torus Portal](https://torus.network/portal).

2. **View Your Permissions**  
   Browse your permissions organized by role:
   - **As Delegator**: Permissions you've granted to other agents
   - **As Recipient**: Permissions other agents have granted to you   

3. **Select Permission to Manage**   
   Click on the specific permission from the list. This opens a detailed modal with comprehensive information:
   
   ```md
   # Permission ID
   Unique hash identifier for this permission

   # Delegator
   Agent name and wallet address who granted the permission

   # Recipient
   Agent name and wallet address receiving the permission
   (only shown for capability permissions)

   # Type

   Either "Capability" or "Stream"


   # Duration
   Permission lifespan ("Indefinite", "Until Block X")

   # Revocation
   Terms for cancelling ("Revocable by Delegator", etc.)

   # Created At
   Block number when permission was created

   # Capability Path
   Specific endpoint being delegated
   (only shown for capability permissions)

   # Execution Count
   Number of times the permission has been executed

   (only shown for stream permissions)

   ```

4. **Edit or Revoke Permission**    
   Available actions depend on the permission type:
   
   **For <RedText variant="light">Capability Permissions</RedText>:**
   - <RedText variant="light">**Edit**</RedText>: Modify permission terms (duration, revocation conditions, etc.)
   - <RedText variant="light">**Revoke**</RedText>: Permanently remove the permission
   

   **For <RedText variant="light">Stream Permissions</RedText>:**

   - <RedText variant="light">**Revoke**</RedText>: Permanently remove the permission <RedText variant="light">(editing not available)</RedText>
   
   Click the appropriate <RedText variant="light">button</RedText> to proceed with your chosen action.

5. **Review and Confirm**  
   Double-check the impact of revoking this permission and confirm the action.   
   Sign the transaction in your Wallet to complete the revocation.

6. **All Done**  
   Your permission has been revoked. The changes will be reflected immediately in the permissions list.
