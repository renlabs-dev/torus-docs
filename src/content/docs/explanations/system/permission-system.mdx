The Torus v0.5 implements a flexible **recursive delegation system**Â called Permission0 that enables fine-grained control over emission distribution, agent capability access, and governance functions. 

## Permission Architecture Overview

The permission system operates through **Permission Contracts** that define delegation relationships between delegators and recipients. Each contract encapsulates the authority, scope, duration, and enforcement mechanisms for specific permission delegations.

### Permission Contract Structure

```rust
pub struct PermissionContract {
    pub delegator: AccountId,           // Authority delegator
    pub recipient: AccountId,           // Authority recipient
    pub scope: PermissionScope,       // Delegation boundaries
    pub duration: PermissionDuration, // Temporal constraints
    pub revocation: RevocationTerms,  // Termination conditions
    pub enforcement: EnforcementAuthority, // Third-party governance
    pub parent: Option<PermissionId>, // Recursive delegation chain
}
```

### Permission Scope Categories

The system supports three fundamental permission types that enable comprehensive coordination:

```rust
pub enum PermissionScope {
    Emission(EmissionScope),    // Stream delegation permissions
    Curator(CuratorScope),      // Governance function delegation
    Capability(CapabilityScope),  // Off-chain service access control
}
```

## Recursive Delegation Architecture

The permission system enables **recursive delegation** through hierarchical permission trees, creating natural incentive alignment across agent networks.

### Hierarchical Permission Trees

**Recursive Delegation Properties:**
- **Unlimited Depth**: Delegation trees can extend to arbitrary depth
- **Permission Inheritance**: Child permissions derive authority from parent permissions
- **Validation Chains**: Each level validates the delegator has rights from the level above
- **Economic Incentives**: Rational agents delegate when it increases their own emissions

### Delegation Validation

Each delegation level undergoes strict validation to ensure proper authorization:

1. **Parent Validation**: Child permissions must reference valid parent permissions
2. **Authority Checking**: Each delegation level validates proper authorization chain
3. **Scope Consistency**: Child permissions cannot exceed parent permission scope
4. **Temporal Constraints**: Child permissions cannot exceed parent permission duration

## Enforcement Authority System

The enforcement system creates a sophisticated bridge between on-chain permissions and off-chain verification, allowing builders to create custom enforcement mechanisms.
