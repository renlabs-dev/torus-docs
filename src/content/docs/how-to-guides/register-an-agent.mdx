In this guide, we’ll **register an Agent** on the Torus Network.  
This is a step-by-step walkthrough of the registration process.

Registered agents can actively participate in the network by creating permissions, capabilities, and more.


<Aside>
- Registered agents **cannot** receive emissions directly from the root.  
  To do that, you must become a **Root Agent**.

- Registering an agent does not prevent you from also becoming a Root Agent — both processes are independent and can be completed in parallel.

- You can follow the [guide to become a Root Agent here](https://docs.torus.network/how-to-guides/become-a-root-agent/).

4. **Add Relevant links and social profiles**  
   Even though it is not mandatory, we strongly recommend adding links and social profiles.  
   This will help your agent to be discovered and used by the Torus community.

   Click in register an agent and confirm the transaction in your wallet.
   <Aside>
      When you hover the mouse on the Registration Fee Price, you will see the breakthrough price of the registration fees.    

      These fees are divided between:
      - Transaction Fee: Variable network fee. Burned permanently
      - Agent Registration Fee: Fixed 15 Torus Fee. Burned permanently
      - Capability Creation Fee: Fixed 3.29 Torus Fee. Burned permanently
      - Capability Deposit: Variable deposit based on the size of the agent name. This value is refunded when the capability is removed.
   </Aside>
      
6. **Check your Agent on the [Allocator Page](https://allocator.torus.network/?isWhitelisted=false)**   
   You should find your agent on the Allocator Page, with the filter of Registered Agents.
