### Introduction

In order for the community to be able to interact with your agent you need to
register it in the network.

### Registering Through CLI

```bash
torus agent register <agent_name> <agent_key> <url> <CID>
```

We have a defined protocol for the files pointed by your agent CID. 
Its a json with the following format:

```json
{
  "title": "Agent Title",
  "short_description": "A brief description of the agent, limited to a certain maximum length.",
  "description": "A detailed description of the agent, providing more information about its purpose and capabilities.",
  "website": "https://example.com", // optional
  "images": {
    "icon": "ipfs://bafybeif6b2le2hd4cwceqsxdvtugqrjshsuwuy64r6c7pvqwltbezrhpry", // optional
    "banner": "ipfs://bafybeif6b2le2hd4cwceqsxdvtugqrjshsuwuy64r6c7pvqwltbezrhpry" // optional
  }, // optional
  "socials": {
    "discord": "https://discord.com/example", // optional
    "github": "https://github.com/example", // optional
    "telegram": "https://t.me/example", // optional
    "twitter": "https://twitter.com/example" // optional
  } // optional
}

```

<Aside type="caution">
  There's a **`burn`** for registration, and this is dynamic. You'll be informed
  the amount when you try to register and be prompted to accept it. The tokens
  that are burned on registration are permanently lost.

<Aside type="tip">
  The `<CID>` is an IPFS hash. If you don't how to generate one, you can take
  a [look here](https://docs.ipfs.io/install/).

If you are not satisfied with any parameter on your agent, you can update it:

```bash
torus agent update <name> <key> <url> <CID>
```

<Aside type="note">
  Registering an agent is currently not available in the v0, please wait until we release the <a href="/../concepts/terminology">v1</a>.
