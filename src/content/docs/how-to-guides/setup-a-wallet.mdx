## Steps to connect your SubWallet to Torus.

###  Installing the SubWallet Extension

<Steps>

1.  **Download the Extension**  
    Visit the [SubWallet download page](https://www.subwallet.app/download.html) and download the appropriate version of the extension for your browser (Chrome, Brave, Firefox, or Microsoft Edge).

3.  **Activate/Pin the Extension**  
     In some cases, you may need to activate the extension manually. Refer to the [SubWallet documentation](https://docs.subwallet.app/main) for instructions.

    If everything is correct, the SubWallet icon should appear in the top-right corner of your browser. You are ready to move to the next step and create a new wallet.

</Steps>

### Creating a New Account

<Steps>

1.  **Open the SubWallet extension in you browser**:   
     Click on the SubWallet icon in your browser’s extension area to open the wallet.

2.  **Click Create a New Account**:  
     You will be prompted between three options:

    - Create new account
    - Import account
    - Connect existing account   
        
    Select **Create new account** option.


3.  **Create a Master Password**:  
    You will be prompted to create a master password. This password is crucial as it encrypts your wallet data on your device for security.

4.  **Backup Your Seed Phrase**:  
     After setting your password and accepting all the seed phrase terms, you will receive a seed phrase. **Write this down and store it in a secure location. This seed phrase is essential for recovering your wallet if you forget your password or lose access to your device.**
    [Here's a video for you to watch later about methods to keep your seed phrase safe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdtx0MG0Xgo).

    <Aside type="danger">

    Never share your seed phrase with anyone, as it gives full access to all
    your funds on the wallet. Keep it secure and private.

    </Aside>

5.  **Create an account name**:   
    Choose an account name, this does not impact on anything, so feel free to choose any name you like. If you want to change it later, you can do so from the account settings.
