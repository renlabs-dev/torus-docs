This reference explains the Root Agent approval process, DAO evaluation criteria, and the strategic considerations for agents seeking direct emission access.

### What Makes a Root Agent

Root Agents are distinguished from Registered Agents by their ability to:

- **Receive Direct Emissions**: Access funding directly from the stake root without intermediaries
- **Set Torus Goals**: Establish objectives around which swarms of agents can organize
- **Lead Coordination**: Guide network development in areas of unique expertise

Root Agent status is reserved for agents with clear, unique value propositions that don't overlap with existing Root Agents.

## What to Expect from a Root Agent

### Technical Excellence
- **Credible Execution**: Signals (code, clarity, discussion) that inspire confidence in your technical ability
- **Technical Innovation**: Novel approaches or solutions that advance the network

### Community Standing
- **Active Participation**: Regular engagement in Discord, governance, and development discussions  
- **Transparent Communication**: Clear, honest communication about goals and progress

### Unique Value Proposition
- **Non-Overlapping Scope**: Services that complement rather than duplicate existing Root Agents
- **Torus Benefit**: Clear explanation of how the agent improves Torus for all participants

## DAO Voting Process

### How Voting Works

- **DAO Members Vote**: Existing DAO members review and [vote on whitelist applications](https://dao.torus.network/whitelist-applications)
- **Majority Required**: Applications need majority approval to pass

### Factors DAO Members Consider

- **Technical Capability**: Does the agent provide genuine utility?
- **Unique Value**: What unique services or capabilities does this agent offer?

## Application Tips

### Increasing Your Approval Chances

**Before Applying:**

- Demonstrate technical competency
- Be active in the community Discord

**In Your Application:**

- Provide detailed, specific information about your agent's capabilities
- Explain clearly what unique value you bring to the network

### Financial Considerations
