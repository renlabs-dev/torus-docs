These docs guide you through building and integrating with Torus web apps—from understanding our structure and stack to installing and developing.

The ecosystem is built using a monorepo with [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs), which allows us to share code and tools across different projects.

<Aside type="tip">
  To access environments pointing to the testnet nodes, add the `.testnet`
  subdomain to the URL, eg. `https://allocator.testnet.torus.network/`
</Aside>

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** - `20.16.0` or higher.
- **PNPM** - `9.7.1` or higher.
- **Docker** - [installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
- **Just** - [installation guide](https://github.com/casey/just).

##### Docker Tip

If you have difficulties or want alternatives to simplify using Docker, consider:

- [Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima): A lightweight solution for running containers on macOS.
- [Orbstack](https://orbstack.dev/): A fast and efficient alternative for managing containers.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone git@github.com:renlabs-dev/torus-ts.git
cd torus-ts
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env

# Build and run
just build
just dev torus-wallet  # or any other app
```

For detailed setup instructions, see the setup guide below.

<Aside type="note">
  Some environment variables required by the `torus-ts` monorepo are sensitive
  and cannot be shared publicly. You’ll need to configure them manually using
  the provided `.env.example` file as a reference.
</Aside>

## Frameworks & Libraries

We use a variety of frameworks and libraries to build our web apps. Here are some of the key ones:

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **Next.js**: React framework for building static and server-rendered applications
- **TypeScript**: Typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript
- **Tailwind**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs
- **Drizzle**: Typesafe ORM for TypeScript
- **tRPC**: TypeScript-first RPC framework for Node.js
- **TanStack Query**: data-fetching library for React
- **Polkadot JS API**: JavaScript API for interacting with Polkadot-based chains
- **Agent API**: Enables decentralized collaboration among autonomous AI agents

This guide will walk you through the process of installing and running the `torus-ts` monorepo.

## Monorepo setup

<br />

<Steps>

1.  ##### Clone the repository

    <Tabs>
      <TabItem label="SSH">
        ```bash
        # Recommended for contributors with SSH keys configured.
          git clone git@github.com:renlabs-dev/torus-ts.git
        ```
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="HTTPS">
        ```bash 
        # Works without SSH key setup.
        git clone https://github.com/renlabs-dev/torus-ts.git 
        ``` 
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="GitHub CLI">
        ```bash
         gh repo clone renlabs-dev/torus-ts 
         ``` 
         Use the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/).
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    <br />

2.  ##### Install the dependencies

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    # or
    just install
    ```

    <br />

3.  ##### Configure environment variables

    There is an `.env.example` in the root directory you can use for reference

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    <br />

4.  ##### Setup database

    <Aside>
      This step is only required for the **`torus-allocator`** &
      **`torus-governance`** apps.
    </Aside>

    Create a postgres container with docker:

    ```bash
    docker run --name torus-db-container \
      -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password \
      -e POSTGRES_DB=torus-ts-db \
      -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres \
      -p 1337:1337 \
      -d postgres:16-alpine \
      postgres -p 1337
    ```

    Push the Drizzle schema to the database:

    ```bash
    just db-push
    ```

    You can also use the `just db-studio` command to open a GUI provided by [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/drizzle-studio/overview).

    <br />

5.  ##### Build the project

        ```bash
        just build
        ```

        <Aside type="caution">
        This step is required before running any app since **`@torus-ts/subspace`** needs to be built and imported indirectly, otherwise dependant packages may typecheck its sources and cause conflict in the generated/augmented types.
        </Aside>

    <br />

6.  ##### Run the project

    From the root directory, run the following command:

    ```bash
    just dev <app-name>  # Run any app
    ```

    <Aside>
      The `app-name` is the name of the app you want to run. You can find the
      list of apps in the `apps` directory. For example, to run the
      `torus-allocator` app, you would run `just dev torus-allocator`.
    </Aside>

    Or from the app directory, run the following command:

    ```bash
    pnpm run dev
    ```

    <Aside>
      To run apps from their directories, you need to set up the environment
      variables inside the app directory as well.
