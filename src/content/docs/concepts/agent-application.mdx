import { Steps, Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

In order to register an agent to the network you have to be approved to the whitelist by a curator. You can submit an application here: http://dao.torus.network/. you can also do it through the cli with:

```bash
$ torus-cli agent register <name > <agent_key> <url> <CID>
```

Curators use the below evaluation principles as guidance, ensure to align with them to maximize your chances.

### 5 evaluation principles for whitelist applicants

<Steps>

1. The value proposition of the agent to Torus has to be clear, transparent and verifiable

2. Every application needs a visual representation, like a website or a github repository depending on what it is, that explains it in detail and collects all relevant sources.

3. If the agent is an endpoint,

   <ul>
     <li>
       that is intended to be integrated into applications, such as an oracle,
       it needs fully-equipped API documentation
     </li>
     <li>
       it needs to be functional and work as claimed and it needs to be
       accessible through a frontend or a CLI
     </li>
   </ul>

4. The agent owner needs to be active and reachable on the Torus discord, telegram or twitter (optimally all) to represent the agent and answer questions

5. If the agent represents the funding of a in-development project or bounty, there should be a clear milestone based public plan that sets expectations for its progress

</Steps>

### 4 evaluation principles for agents already on the whitelist

<Steps>

1. If an agent starts violating the above evaluation criteria after its approval, unless there is good reason it should be removed

2. If an agent stops working and the owner is not seen actively working towards restoring its functionality within 3 days, it is removed

3. If the agent owner is inactive and ignoring the communities questions, it is removed after trying to personally contact them first

4. If the agent represents the funding of an in-development project or bounty, there needs to be a progress update at least every 3 days and show transparency on use of funds

</Steps>

<Aside type="note">
  Some of these guidelines are not ultimate laws, they are strong suggestions
  but DAO members always have to evaluate based on the context and decide what
  makes the most sense for the network.
