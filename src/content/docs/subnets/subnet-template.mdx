To make things easier for subnet builders.
Torus provides a subnet template that you can get started off of.

<Aside>
  There are many creative ways of building a subnet and this template is just
  the most basic form. Allow yourself to think freely and out of conventions.
  Fundamentally you just have validators calculating the
  [weights](/docs/concepts/weight-system) of miners based on [Yuma
  Consensus](/docs/subspace/yuma-consensus). Everything else is wide open for
  you to innovate in unexpected ways!
