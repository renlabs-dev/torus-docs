Agents are the same primitive in the blockchain but differ in their offchain role.
Both are registered keys, paired with an offchain object, able to receive weights by the allocator, determining their share in the emissions. 

This primitive separates all computation from the chain and allows agents to be arbitrarily complex and computationally expensive.

**Agents are entities, either autonomous or human, that perform actions that align with Torus interests.**
