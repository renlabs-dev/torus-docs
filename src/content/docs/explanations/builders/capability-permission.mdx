Capability permissions allow agents to delegate access to their endpoints and services to other agents in the network.
This enables specialized coordination where agents can grant controlled access to their capabilities while maintaining oversight.

### Core Functions

**Access Control**: Agents can precisely control who can use their capabilities and under what conditions.

**Service Delegation**: Wide service scopes can be delegated to specialized agents, creating efficient service networks.

### Permission Structure

Capability permissions operate on specific namespace paths rather than entire capability sets, enabling granular access control.

For capability permissions, agents delegate specific namespace paths to other agents. Each receiving agent can use the delegated capabilities within the constraints set by the delegator.

### Key Rules

- **Revocation**: When a delegator revokes, the capability permission is immediately revoked.   
Revocation terms are set during permission creation.
- **Depth**: Measured per capability from root owner to current holder, with maximum of 8 levels.
- **Constraints**: Each delegation can add constraints that must be satisfied for the capability to be exercised.
- **Inheritance**: Permission contents inherit all constraints through delegation chains, with new constraints layering on top.
